00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,411
Next subject: Kowalski, Leon.

2
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,643
Engineer, waste disposal.

3
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,009
File section: New employee, six days.

4
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,290
Calling Mr. Webber...

5
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,165
- Come in.
- ...please report tn Zane A Sector 9.

6
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,804
Replication Center Level 9,
we have a B1 security alert.

7
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,480
Stand by for ID check, please.

8
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,081
Sit down.

9
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,729
Replication Center Level 9,
we have a B1 security alert.

10
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,887
Stand by for...

11
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,241
Care if I talk?

12
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,524
I'm kind of nervous when I take tests.

13
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,449
Just please don't move.

14
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,130
Oh. sorry.

15
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,244
I already had an IQ test.
I don't think I've had one of these.

16
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,568
Reaction time is a factor.
so pay attention.

17
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,206
Now answer as quickly as you can.

18
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,085
Sure.

19
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,650
1187 at Hunterwasser.

20
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,807
That's the hotel.

21
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,002
- What?
- Where I live.

22
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,804
- Nice place?
- Yeah. sure. I guess.

23
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,570
Is that part of the test?

24
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,286
No. Just warming you up. That's all.

25
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,362
It's not fancy or anything.

26
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,926
You're in a desert.
walking along in the sand. when--

27
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,087
Is this the test. now?

28
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,647
Yes. You're in a desert.
walking along in the sand...

29
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,490
- ...when you look down--
- What one?

30
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,330
- What?
- What desert?

31
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,171
Doesn't make any difference.
It's completely hypothetical.

32
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,567
- But how come I'd be there?
- Maybe you're fed up.

33
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,967
Maybe you wanna be by yourself.
Who knows?

34
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,165
You look down and see a tortoise.

35
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,807
- It's crawling towards you--
- Tortoise? What's that?

36
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,041
- You know what a turtle is?
- Of course.

37
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,730
Same thing.

38
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,445
I've never seen a turtle.

39
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,411
But I understand what you mean.

40
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,171
You reach down.
you flip the tortoise over on its back.

41
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,601
Do you make up these questions.
Mr. Holden?

42
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,802
Or do they write them down for you?

43
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,765
The tortoise lays on its back.
Its belly baking in the sun...

44
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,884
...beating its legs.
trying to turn itself over. but it can't...

45
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,491
...not without your help.

46
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,808
- You're not helping.
- What do you mean I'm not?

47
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,240
I mean. you're not helping.

48
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,767
Why is that. Leon?

49
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,487
They're just questions, Leon.

50
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,885
In answer to your query.
they're written down for me.

51
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,165
It's a test designed to provoke
an emotional response.

52
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,523
Shall we continue?

53
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,287
Describe in single words only the
good things that come into your mind...

54
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,570
...about your mother.

55
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,161
- My mother?
- Yeah.

56
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,727
Let me tell you about my mother.

57
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,760
A new life awaits you
in the Off-world colonies.

58
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,924
The chance to begin again...

59
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,966
...in a golden land of opportunity
and adventure.

60
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,885
A new life awaits you
in the Off-world colonies.

61
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,730
The chance to begin again...

62
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,606
...in a golden land of opportunity
and adventure.

63
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,922
New climate, recreational facilities...

64
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,522
They don't advertise for killers
in a newspaper.

65
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,927
That was my profession.

66
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,645
Ex-cop.

67
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,969
Ex-Blade Runner. Ex-killer.

68
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:42,121
Use your new friend as
a personal servant or field hand.

69
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,802
The custom-tailored, genetically
engineered humanoid Replicant...

70
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,083
...designed especially for your needs.

71
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,921
So come on, America.
Let's put out...

72
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,124
Give me four.

73
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,763
No. four. Two. two. Four.

74
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,486
And noodles.

75
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,241
Sushi. That's what
my ex-wife called me.

76
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,407
Cold fish.

77
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,806
Hey.

78
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,281
He say you under arrest. Mr. Deckard.

79
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,605
Got the wrong guy. pal.

80
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,365
He say you Blade Runner.

81
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,925
Tell him I'm eating.

82
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,246
Captain Bryant...

83
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,245
Bryant. huh?

84
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,008
Yellow 3.

85
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,726
Climb and maintain 4000.

86
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,927
The charmer': name was Gaff.
I'd seen him around.

87
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,566
Bryant must have upped him
to the Blade Runner unit.

88
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,969
That gibberish he talked was Cityspeak,
gutter talk.

89
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,926
A mishmash of Japanese, Spanish,
German, what have you.

90
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,409
I didn't really need a translator.
I knew the lingo. Every good cop did.

91
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,887
But I wasn't gonna
make it easier for him.

92
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,602
Final descent.

93
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,610
Now on glide path. Mark course.

94
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,723
Over the landing threshold.

95
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,647
Hiya. Deck.

96
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,046
Bryant.

97
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,369
You wouldn't have come
if I just asked you to. Sit down, pal.

98
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,924
Come on. don't be an asshole. Deckard.
I've got four skin-jobs walking the streets.

99
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,167
"Skin-jobs."
That's what Bryant called Replicants.

100
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,490
In history books, he's the kind of cop
used to call black men niggers.

101
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,524
They jumped a shuttle Off-world.
killed the crew and passengers.

102
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,610
They found the shuttle drifting
off the coast two weeks ago...

103
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,609
...so we know they're around.

104
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,086
Embarrassing.

105
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,568
No. not embarrassing. No one's ever
gonna find out they're down here.

106
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,206
Because you're gonna spot them
and air them out.

107
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,606
I don't work here anymore.

108
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,927
Give it to Holden.

109
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,323
- He's good.
- I did.

110
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,887
He can breathe okay
as long as nobody unplugs him.

111
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,809
He's not good enough.
Not good as you.

112
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,490
I need you, Deck.

113
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,921
Now. this is a bad one, the worst yet.

114
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,563
I need the old Blade Runner.

115
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,250
I need your magic.

116
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,285
I was quit when I come in here. Bryant.

117
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,889
I'm twice as quit now.

118
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,811
Stop right where you are.
You know the score, pal?

119
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,642
If you're not cop. you're little people.

120
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,611
No choice. huh?

121
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,969
No choice. pal.

122
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,209
I already had an IQ test this year.

123
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,368
I don't think I've ever
had one of these.

124
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,927
Reaction time is a factor,
so please pay attention.

125
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,088
- Answer as quickly as you can.
- Yeah, sure.

126
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,124
1187 at Hunterwasser.

127
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,651
Yeah. That's the hotel.

128
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,968
- What?
- Where I live.

129
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,288
- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.

130
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,324
There was an escape from
the Off-world colonies two weeks ago.

131
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,841
Six Replicants: three male, three female.

132
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,407
They slaughtered 23 people
and jumped a shuttle.

133
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,762
An aerial patrol spotted
the ship off the coast.

134
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,644
No crew. no sight of them.

135
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,810
Three nights ago they tried to break
into Tyrell Corporation.

136
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,241
One got fried running
through an electrical field.

137
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,249
We lost the others.

138
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,682
On the possibility they might try
to infiltrate as employees...

139
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,885
...I had Holden go over and run
Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers.

140
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,764
Looks like he got himself one.

141
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,362
So you look down and you see a tortoise.
It's crawling towards you.

142
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,562
Tortoise? What's that?

143
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,762
- Know what a turtle is?
- Of course.

144
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,122
- Same thing.
- I've never seen a turtle.

145
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,884
I don't get it. What do they risk coming
back to Earth for? That's unusual. Why...?

146
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,686
What do they want
out of the Tyrell Corporation?

147
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,531
Well. you tell me. pal.
That's what you're here for.

148
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,842
- What's this?
- Nexus 6. Roy Batty.

149
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,883
Incept date: 2016.

150
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,686
Combat model. Optimum self-sufficiency.

151
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,849
Probably the leader.

152
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,685
This is Zhora.

153
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,201
She's trained for
an Off-world kick murder squad.

154
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,686
Talk about Beauty and the Beast.
She's both.

155
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,361
The fourth skin-job is Pris.
a basic pleasure model.

156
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,245
The standard item for military clubs
in the outer colonies.

157
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,007
They were designed to copy human beings
in every way except their emotions.

158
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,168
The designers reckoned
after a few years...

159
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,727
...they might develop
their own emotional responses.

160
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,166
Oh. hate. love. fear. anger. envy.

161
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,442
So they built in a fail-safe device.

162
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,803
- Which is what?
- Four-year lifespan.

163
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,082
Now. there's a Nexus 6
over at the Tyrell Corporation.

164
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,285
- I want you to go put the machine on it.
- And if the machine doesn't work?

165
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,602
I'd quit because I'd had
a bellyful of killing.

166
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,046
But, then, I'd rather be a killer
than a victim...

167
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,642
...and that's exactly what Bryant's
threat about little people meant.

168
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,243
So I hooked in once more, thinking
that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later.

169
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,727
I didn't have to worry about Gaff.

170
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,687
He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.

171
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,527
Do you like our owl?

172
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,570
It's artificial?

173
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,403
Of course it is.

174
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,966
Must be expensive.

175
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,487
Very. I'm Rachael.

176
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,367
Deckard.

177
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,651
It seems you feel our work
is not a benefit to the public.

178
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,565
Replicants are like any other machine:
They're either a benefit or a hazard.

179
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,366
If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.

180
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,245
May I ask you a personal question?

181
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,484
Sure.

182
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,607
Have you ever retired a human
by mistake?

183
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,847
No.

184
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,647
- But in your position, that is a risk.
- Is this to be an empathy test?

185
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,328
Capillary dilation
of the so-called blush response?

186
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,043
Fluctuation of the pupil.

187
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,890
Involuntary dilation of the iris.

188
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,084
We call it Voight-Kampff for short.

189
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,248
Mr. Deckard. Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

190
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,009
Demonstrate it.

191
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,080
I wanna see it work.

192
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,760
- Where's the subject?
- I wanna see it work on a person.

193
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,725
I wanna see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.

194
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,524
What's that gonna prove?

195
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,369
Indulge me.

196
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,005
On you?

197
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,406
Try her.

198
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,722
It's too bright in here.

199
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,761
Do you mind if I smoke?

200
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,491
It won't affect the test.

201
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,604
All right. I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

202
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,043
Just relax and answer them
as simply as you can.

203
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,329
It's your birthday.
Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.

204
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,249
I wouldn't accept it.

205
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,650
Also. I'd report the person
who gave it to me to the police.

206
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,883
You've got a little boy.
He shows you his butterfly collection...

207
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,809
...plus the killing jar.

208
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,645
I'd take him to the doctor.

209
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,720
You're watching television.

210
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,491
Suddenly you realize
there's a wasp crawling on your arm.

211
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,762
I'd kill it.

212
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,042
You're reading a magazine. You come
across a full-page nude photo of a girl.

213
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,244
Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant
or a lesbian. Mr. Deckard?

214
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,602
Just answer the questions. please.

215
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,445
You show it to your husband.

216
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,041
He likes it so much
he hangs it on your bedroom wall.

217
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,605
- -Bush outside your window?

218
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,040
I wouldn't let him.

219
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,605
- -Orange body, green legs?

220
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,040
Why not?

221
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,242
I should be enough for him.

222
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,769
One more question.

223
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,450
You're watching a stage play.
a banquet is in progress.

224
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,565
The guests are enjoying
an appetizer of raw oysters.

225
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,684
The entrée consists of boiled dog.

226
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,080
Would you step out
for a few moments. Rachael?

227
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,930
Thank you.

228
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,401
She's a Replicant. isn't she?

229
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,250
I'm impressed.

230
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,966
How many questions
does it usually take to spot one?

231
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,731
- I don't get it. Tyrell.
- How many questions?

232
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,491
Twenty. thirty. cross-referenced.

233
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,081
It took more than a hundred for Rachael.
didn't it?

234
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,009
She doesn't know.

235
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,884
She's beginning to suspect. I think.

236
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,048
Suspect?
How can it not know what it is?

237
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,251
Commerce is our goal here at Tyrell.

238
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,568
“More human than human“ is our motto.

239
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,242
Rachael is an experiment. nothing more.

240
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,650
We began to recognize in them
a strange obsession.

241
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,083
After all. they are emotionally
inexperienced. with only a few years...

242
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,602
...in which to store up the experiences
which you and I take for granted.

243
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:08,045
If we gift them with a past. we create
a cushion or a pillow for their emotions...

244
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,891
...then consequently
we can control them better.

245
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,809
Memories.

246
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,843
You're talking about memories.

247
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,127
Reaction time is a factor,
so please pay attention.

248
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,163
- Now answer as quickly as you can.
- Sure.

249
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,840
-1187 at Hunterwasser.
- Yeah. That's the hotel.

250
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,166
- What?
- Where I live.

251
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,885
- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.

252
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,809
J's that part of the test?
- No.

253
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,249
I didn't know whether Leon
gave Holden a legit address...

254
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,161
...but it was the only lead I had,
so I checked it out.

255
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,370
Whatever was in the bathtub
was not human.

256
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,040
Replicants don't have scales.

257
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,329
And family photos?
Replicants didn't have families either.

258
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,201
Time...

259
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,526
...enough.

260
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,690
Did you get your precious photos?

261
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,488
Someone was there.

262
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,804
Men?

263
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,608
Policemen?

264
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,083
Fiery the angels fell

265
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,363
Deep thunder rolled around their shores

266
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,963
Burning with the fires of Orc

267
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,962
You not come here! Illegal!

268
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,325
Hey! Hey!

269
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,683
Cold! Those are my eyes! Freezing!

270
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,445
Yes.

271
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,085
Questions.

272
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,888
Hey! Hey!

273
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,764
Morphology. Longevity. lncept dates.

274
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,371
Don't know.

275
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,722
I don't know such stuff.

276
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,403
I just do eyes.

277
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,285
Just eyes. just genetic design.

278
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,209
Just eyes.

279
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,168
You Nexus. huh?

280
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,806
I design your eyes.

281
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,889
Chew...

282
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,927
...if only you could see
what I've seen with your eyes.

283
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,929
Now...

284
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,849
...questions.

285
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,008
I don't know answers.

286
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,929
Who does?

287
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,611
Tyrell.

288
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,086
He knows everything.

289
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,161
Tyrell Corporation?

290
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,206
He big boss. Big genius.
He design your mind.

291
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,164
Your brain, huh?

292
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,924
Smart.

293
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,722
Very cold.

294
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,247
Not an easy man to see...

295
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,367
Give me coat.

296
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,760
"'I guess?

297
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,763
Sebastian.

298
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,609
He take you there.
He take you there.

299
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,201
Sebastian who?

300
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,285
J.F...

301
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,290
...Sebast...

302
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,569
Now...

303
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,883
...where...

304
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,004
...would we find this...

305
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,488
...J.F. Sebastian?

306
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,162
Let's continue, shall we?

307
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,328
Describe in single words...

308
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,002
...only the good things that come
into your mind about your mother.

309
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,202
- My mother?
- Yeah.

310
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,890
I'll tell you about my mother.

311
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,050
Voice print identification.
Your ﬂoor number, please.

312
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,040
Deckard. 97.
- 97. Thank you. Danke.

313
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,408
I wanted to see you.

314
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,204
So I waited.

315
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,289
Let me help you.

316
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,402
What do I need help for?

317
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,407
I don't know why
he told you what he did.

318
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,601
Talk to him.

319
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,282
He wouldn't see me.

320
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,884
You want a drink?

321
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,845
No?

322
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,246
You think I'm a Replicant. don't you?

323
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,250
Look.

324
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,646
It's me with my mother.

325
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,165
Yeah?

326
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,606
Remember when you were 6?

327
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,282
You and your brother snuck into an empty
building through a basement window.

328
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,687
You were gonna play doctor?

329
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,007
He showed you his. and when it got
to be your turn. you chickened and ran.

330
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,770
Remember that?

331
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,084
Did you ever tell anybody that?
Your mother. Tyrell. anybody. huh?

332
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,249
You remember the spider that lived
in the bush outside your window?

333
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,281
Orange body. green legs?

334
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,086
Watched her build a web all summer?

335
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,567
Then one day. there's a big egg in it.

336
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,364
The egg hatched...

337
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,961
- The egg hatched...
- And?

338
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,210
...and a hundred baby spiders came out.

339
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,640
And they ate her.

340
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,969
Implants.

341
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,766
Those aren't your memories.
they're somebody else's.

342
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,281
They're Tyrell's niece's.

343
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,564
Okay-

344
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,250
Bad joke.

345
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,930
I made a bad joke.

346
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,690
You're not a Replicant.

347
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,847
Go home.

348
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,610
Okay?

349
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,644
No. really. I'm sorry.

350
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,850
Go home.

351
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,361
Want a drink?

352
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,322
I'll get you a drink.

353
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,727
I'll get a glass.

354
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,605
Tyrell really did a job on Rachael.

355
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,202
Right down to a snapshot
of a mother she never had...

356
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,084
...a daughter she never was.

357
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,649
Replicants weren't supposed to
have feelings.

358
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,002
Neither were Blade Runners.

359
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,043
What the hell was happening to me?

360
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,090
Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's.

361
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,090
I didn't know why a Replicant
would collect photos.

362
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,404
Maybe they were like Rachael,
they needed memories.

363
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,091
Hey!

364
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,162
You forgot your bag.

365
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,123
I'm lost.

366
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,323
Don't worry. I won't hurt you.

367
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,486
What's your name?

368
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,843
- Pris.
- Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

369
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,963
- Hi.
- Hi.

370
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,168
Oh. where were you going?

371
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,605
Home?

372
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,684
I don't have one.

373
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,122
We scared each other pretty good.
didn't we?

374
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,004
We sure did.

375
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,482
I'm hungry. J.F.

376
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,201
I got stuff inside.

377
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,005
You wanna come in?

378
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,407
I was hoping you'd say that.

379
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,248
Do you live in this building
all by yourself?

380
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,444
Yeah. I live here
pretty much alone right now.

381
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,480
No housing shortage around here.

382
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,881
Plenty of room for everybody.

383
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,767
Watch out for the water.

384
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,405
Must get lonely here. J.F.

385
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,971
Not really. I make friends.

386
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,369
They're toys. My friends are toys.
I make them.

387
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,767
It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer.

388
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,724
Do you know what that is?

389
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,410
No.

390
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,731
Ma'am.

391
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,885
Hello.

392
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,891
Yoo-hoo. home again.

393
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,371
Home again. home again. jiggidy-jig.

394
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,484
- Good evening. J.F.
- Evening. fellas.

395
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,087
They're my friends. I made them.

396
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,009
Where are your folks?

397
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,611
I'm sort of an orphan.

398
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,885
What about your friends?

399
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,401
I have some. but I have to find them.

400
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,046
I'll let them know where I am tomorrow.

401
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,450
Can I take those things for you?
They're soaked, aren't they?

402
00:41:52,723 --> 00:41:55,249
Enhance 224 to 176.

403
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:13,528
Enhance.

404
00:42:13,723 --> 00:42:15,088
Stop.

405
00:42:28,323 --> 00:42:30,052
Move in.

406
00:42:30,243 --> 00:42:31,768
Stop.

407
00:42:32,443 --> 00:42:34,127
Pull out. track right.

408
00:42:34,323 --> 00:42:36,007
Stop.

409
00:42:37,243 --> 00:42:39,530
Center and pull back.

410
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:43,367
Stop.

411
00:42:44,443 --> 00:42:46,127
Track 45 right.

412
00:42:48,123 --> 00:42:49,170
Stop.

413
00:42:49,363 --> 00:42:51,047
Center and stop.

414
00:42:56,723 --> 00:42:59,647
Enhance 34 to 36.

415
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:11,364
Pan right and pull back.

416
00:43:12,203 --> 00:43:13,693
Stop.

417
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,567
Enhance 34 to 46.

418
00:43:32,123 --> 00:43:34,012
Pull back.

419
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,973
Wait a minute. Go right.

420
00:43:37,403 --> 00:43:38,928
Stop.

421
00:43:39,363 --> 00:43:40,694
Enhance 57-19.

422
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:45,404
Track 45 left.

423
00:43:47,043 --> 00:43:48,772
Stop.

424
00:43:50,403 --> 00:43:53,009
Enhance 15 to 23.

425
00:44:03,483 --> 00:44:05,724
Give me a hard copy right there.

426
00:45:00,203 --> 00:45:01,693
Fish?

427
00:45:16,403 --> 00:45:19,293
I think it was manufactured locally.

428
00:45:23,723 --> 00:45:28,172
Finest quality. Superior workmanship.

429
00:45:29,003 --> 00:45:31,131
There is the maker's serial number.

430
00:45:31,323 --> 00:45:37,569
9906947-XB71.

431
00:45:38,323 --> 00:45:39,563
Interesting.

432
00:45:40,683 --> 00:45:44,404
Not fish. Snake scale.

433
00:45:44,603 --> 00:45:45,934
Snake.

434
00:45:46,123 --> 00:45:50,572
Try Abdul Ben Hassan.
He make this snake!

435
00:46:33,683 --> 00:46:35,333
Abdul Hassan?

436
00:46:36,363 --> 00:46:39,572
I'm a police officer.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

437
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:42,687
Artificial snake license XB71. that's you?

438
00:46:43,683 --> 00:46:46,368
This is your work, huh?
Who did you sell it to?

439
00:46:46,563 --> 00:46:49,134
My work? Not too many
could afford such quality.

440
00:46:49,323 --> 00:46:50,370
How many?

441
00:46:50,563 --> 00:46:52,645
- Very few.
- How few?

442
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:54,413
- Look. my friend--
- Taffey Lewis'.

443
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,971
Down in Fourth Sector. Chinatown.

444
00:47:10,403 --> 00:47:12,132
Bartender.

445
00:47:15,603 --> 00:47:17,412
Taffey Lewis?

446
00:47:18,163 --> 00:47:19,688
Thank you.

447
00:47:22,523 --> 00:47:24,287
Taffey.

448
00:47:24,923 --> 00:47:27,051
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

449
00:47:27,243 --> 00:47:28,927
Blow.

450
00:47:30,563 --> 00:47:32,770
You ever buy snakes
from the Egyptian, Taffey?

451
00:47:32,963 --> 00:47:34,294
All the time. pal.

452
00:47:37,043 --> 00:47:38,283
You ever see this girl. huh?

453
00:47:39,763 --> 00:47:41,174
Never seen her. Buzz off.

454
00:47:41,363 --> 00:47:43,092
Your licenses in order, pal?

455
00:47:43,883 --> 00:47:45,294
Hey. Louie.

456
00:47:45,483 --> 00:47:49,852
The man is dry. Give him one
on the house, okay? See?

457
00:48:30,483 --> 00:48:32,087
Hello?

458
00:48:33,923 --> 00:48:37,370
I've had people walk out on me before.
but not when...

459
00:48:37,563 --> 00:48:39,645
...I was being so charming.

460
00:48:39,843 --> 00:48:43,689
I'm in a bar. here now.
down in the Fourth Sector.

461
00:48:44,803 --> 00:48:46,134
Taffey Lewis is on the line.

462
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:49,372
Why don't you come on down here
and have a drink?

463
00:48:49,563 --> 00:48:51,964
I don't think so, Mr. Deckard.

464
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,403
That's not my kind of place.

465
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:56,050
Go someplace else?

466
00:49:11,363 --> 00:49:13,764
Ladies and gentlemen...

467
00:49:13,963 --> 00:49:18,969
...Taffey Lewis presents
Miss Salome and the snake.

468
00:49:19,163 --> 00:49:23,327
Watch her take the pleasure
from the serpent...

469
00:49:23,523 --> 00:49:27,084
...that once corrupted man.

470
00:50:07,643 --> 00:50:10,214
Excuse me. Miss Salome.
can I talk to you for a minute?

471
00:50:10,403 --> 00:50:14,328
I'm from the American Federation
of Variety Artists.

472
00:50:14,523 --> 00:50:15,490
Oh. yeah?

473
00:50:15,683 --> 00:50:19,290
I'm not here to make you join.
No. ma'am. That's not my department.

474
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,247
Actually...

475
00:50:23,363 --> 00:50:27,573
...I'm from the Confidential Committee
on Moral Abuses.

476
00:50:28,523 --> 00:50:30,252
Committee of Moral Abuses?

477
00:50:30,443 --> 00:50:32,491
There's been reports
that the management...

478
00:50:32,683 --> 00:50:34,731
...has been taking liberties
with the artists.

479
00:50:34,923 --> 00:50:36,288
I don't know nothing about it.

480
00:50:36,483 --> 00:50:39,327
Have you felt yourself to be
exploited in any way?

481
00:50:39,523 --> 00:50:41,844
How do you mean “exploited“?

482
00:50:42,043 --> 00:50:44,444
Well. like to get this job.

483
00:50:44,643 --> 00:50:49,331
I mean. did you do. or were you
asked to do, anything that's...

484
00:50:49,523 --> 00:50:51,605
...lewd or unsavory or...

485
00:50:51,803 --> 00:50:55,489
...otherwise repulsive
to your person, huh?

486
00:50:58,123 --> 00:51:00,854
- Are you for real?
- Oh. yeah.

487
00:51:01,043 --> 00:51:04,126
I'd like to check
your dressing room. if I may.

488
00:51:04,323 --> 00:51:06,894
- For what?
- For holes.

489
00:51:07,083 --> 00:51:08,050
Holes?

490
00:51:08,243 --> 00:51:09,042
Well. you'd be surprised
what a guy would go through...

491
00:51:09,043 --> 00:51:10,886
Well. you'd be surprised
what a guy would go through...

492
00:51:11,083 --> 00:51:13,768
...to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

493
00:51:16,843 --> 00:51:17,890
No. I wouldn't.

494
00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:20,085
Little...

495
00:51:20,283 --> 00:51:25,494
...dirty holes they drill in the wall
so they can watch a lady undress.

496
00:51:57,523 --> 00:52:00,686
- Is this a real snake?
- Of course it's not real.

497
00:52:00,883 --> 00:52:04,808
Think I'd be working in a place like this
if I could afford a real snake?

498
00:52:18,363 --> 00:52:21,207
So if somebody does try to exploit me.
who do I go to about it?

499
00:52:21,403 --> 00:52:25,374
- Me.
- You're a dedicated man. Dry me.

500
00:52:50,723 --> 00:52:52,407
The only thing they care about--

501
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:53,729
Hey!

502
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:19,494
Cross now. Cross now.

503
00:54:19,683 --> 00:54:22,687
Cross now. Cross now.

504
00:54:22,883 --> 00:54:25,454
Cross now. Cross now.

505
00:54:25,643 --> 00:54:28,408
Cross now. Cross now.

506
00:54:28,603 --> 00:54:31,766
Cross now. Cross now.

507
00:54:32,403 --> 00:54:34,451
Don't walk. Don't walk.

508
00:54:34,643 --> 00:54:36,645
Don't walk. Don't walk.

509
00:54:36,843 --> 00:54:39,733
Don't walk. Don't walk. Don't walk.

510
00:54:53,883 --> 00:54:56,887
Cross now. Cross now.

511
00:54:57,083 --> 00:54:59,814
Cross now. Cross now.

512
00:55:00,003 --> 00:55:02,131
Cross now. Cross now.

513
00:55:02,843 --> 00:55:05,687
Cross now. Cross now.

514
00:55:05,883 --> 00:55:07,373
Cross now. Cross now.

515
00:55:07,563 --> 00:55:09,292
Move! Get out of the way!

516
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:34,131
The report would be
"routine retirement of a Replicant"...

517
00:56:34,323 --> 00:56:39,124
...which didn't make me feel any better
about shooting a woman in the back.

518
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:41,445
There it was again.

519
00:56:41,643 --> 00:56:46,046
Feeling. In myself. For her.

520
00:56:46,283 --> 00:56:48,092
Far Rachael.

521
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:52,773
Deckard.

522
00:56:52,963 --> 00:56:54,453
B26354.

523
00:57:00,723 --> 00:57:03,329
Move on. Move on.

524
00:57:03,523 --> 00:57:05,651
Move on. Move on.

525
00:57:05,843 --> 00:57:08,926
Move on. Move on.

526
00:57:14,363 --> 00:57:15,967
A minute.

527
00:57:18,163 --> 00:57:19,608
Yeah. what do you want?

528
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:21,487
Tsingtao.

529
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,212
This enough?

530
00:57:30,403 --> 00:57:31,814
Yeah.

531
00:57:40,163 --> 00:57:41,892
Bryant.

532
00:58:01,003 --> 00:58:04,769
Christ. Deckard. you look almost as bad
as that skin-job you left on the sidewalk.

533
00:58:04,963 --> 00:58:06,124
I'm going home.

534
00:58:06,323 --> 00:58:08,132
Could learn from this guy. Gaff.

535
00:58:08,323 --> 00:58:10,974
He's a goddamn one-man slaughterhouse.
that's what he is.

536
00:58:11,763 --> 00:58:13,413
Four more to go.

537
00:58:13,603 --> 00:58:15,253
- Come on. Gaff. let's go.
- Three.

538
00:58:17,483 --> 00:58:18,564
There's three to go.

539
00:58:19,203 --> 00:58:21,331
There's four.

540
00:58:21,523 --> 00:58:24,208
That skin-job you VK'd
at the Tyrell Corporation...

541
00:58:24,403 --> 00:58:28,089
...Rachael. disappeared, vanished.
Didn't even know she was a Replicant.

542
00:58:28,283 --> 00:58:31,014
Something to do with a brain implant.
says Tyrell.

543
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:34,366
Come on. Gaff.
Drink some for me, huh. pal?

544
00:59:17,203 --> 00:59:18,170
Leon.

545
00:59:18,363 --> 00:59:19,967
How old am I?

546
00:59:23,963 --> 00:59:25,727
I don't know.

547
00:59:27,923 --> 00:59:31,006
My birthday's April 10, 2017.
How long do I live?

548
00:59:31,203 --> 00:59:32,887
Four years.

549
00:59:39,643 --> 00:59:40,804
More than you.

550
00:59:45,643 --> 00:59:48,249
Painful to live in fear, isn't it?

551
00:59:53,603 --> 00:59:56,686
Nothing is worse than having
an itch you can never scratch.

552
00:59:57,643 --> 00:59:58,974
I agree.

553
01:00:09,683 --> 01:00:11,526
Wake up. Time to die.

554
01:00:45,243 --> 01:00:47,007
Shakes?

555
01:00:48,563 --> 01:00:50,053
Me too.

556
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:55,692
I get them bad.

557
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:03,131
It's part of the business.

558
01:01:10,123 --> 01:01:11,409
I'm not in the business.

559
01:01:24,443 --> 01:01:26,525
I am the business.

560
01:02:55,683 --> 01:02:56,844
What if I go north?

561
01:03:00,963 --> 01:03:02,772
Disappear.

562
01:03:07,003 --> 01:03:08,243
Would you come after me?

563
01:03:10,323 --> 01:03:11,927
Hunt me?

564
01:03:16,523 --> 01:03:18,048
No.

565
01:03:20,643 --> 01:03:22,532
No. I wouldn't.

566
01:03:28,083 --> 01:03:29,164
I owe you one.

567
01:03:43,843 --> 01:03:45,971
But somebody would.

568
01:03:57,843 --> 01:03:59,652
Deckard...

569
01:04:02,043 --> 01:04:04,091
...you know those files on me?

570
01:04:05,403 --> 01:04:08,850
The incept date. The longevity.

571
01:04:09,043 --> 01:04:10,852
Those things.

572
01:04:12,163 --> 01:04:13,892
You saw them?

573
01:04:17,203 --> 01:04:18,853
They're...

574
01:04:19,043 --> 01:04:20,169
...classified.

575
01:04:20,363 --> 01:04:22,730
But you're a policeman.

576
01:04:22,923 --> 01:04:24,891
L...

577
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:26,926
...didn't look at them.

578
01:04:28,963 --> 01:04:31,091
You know.
that Voight-Kampff test of yours...

579
01:04:32,163 --> 01:04:34,928
...did you ever take that test yourself?

580
01:04:46,243 --> 01:04:47,927
Deckard.

581
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:13,733
I dreamt music.

582
01:07:18,723 --> 01:07:21,203
I didn't know if I could play.

583
01:07:22,843 --> 01:07:25,449
I remember lessons.

584
01:07:26,323 --> 01:07:30,089
I don't know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.

585
01:07:34,563 --> 01:07:36,725
You play beautifully.

586
01:08:43,963 --> 01:08:46,284
Now you kiss me.

587
01:08:47,683 --> 01:08:49,048
I can't rely on my--

588
01:08:49,243 --> 01:08:51,723
Say. "Kiss me.“

589
01:08:54,403 --> 01:08:56,167
Kiss me.

590
01:09:07,203 --> 01:09:09,012
I want you.

591
01:09:12,003 --> 01:09:13,448
I want you.

592
01:09:13,643 --> 01:09:15,133
Again.

593
01:09:15,323 --> 01:09:17,087
I want you.

594
01:09:20,163 --> 01:09:22,450
Put your hands on me.

595
01:10:40,964 --> 01:10:44,127
- What you doing?
- I'm sorry. Just peeking.

596
01:10:47,884 --> 01:10:50,854
- How do I look?
- You look better.

597
01:10:51,044 --> 01:10:53,934
- Just better?
- Well ...

598
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:55,285
...you look beautiful.

599
01:10:58,804 --> 01:11:00,374
Thanks.

600
01:11:06,564 --> 01:11:08,373
How old are you?

601
01:11:10,244 --> 01:11:12,167
Twenty-five.

602
01:11:12,364 --> 01:11:15,129
- What's your problem?
- Methuselah syndrome.

603
01:11:15,324 --> 01:11:16,564
What's that?

604
01:11:16,764 --> 01:11:19,608
My glands. they grow old too fast.

605
01:11:20,804 --> 01:11:24,809
- Is that why you're still on Earth?
- Yeah. I couldn't pass the medical.

606
01:11:27,724 --> 01:11:28,850
anyway- - -

607
01:11:29,044 --> 01:11:30,409
...I kind of like it here.

608
01:11:33,004 --> 01:11:34,847
I like you...

609
01:11:35,044 --> 01:11:36,205
...just the way you are.

610
01:11:39,364 --> 01:11:41,048
Hi. Roy.

611
01:11:41,244 --> 01:11:42,575
Hi.

612
01:11:42,764 --> 01:11:44,368
Gosh. you...

613
01:11:44,564 --> 01:11:46,726
...really got some nice toys here.

614
01:11:46,924 --> 01:11:49,165
This is the friend I was telling you about.

615
01:11:49,364 --> 01:11:52,413
This is my savior, J.F. Sebastian.

616
01:11:52,604 --> 01:11:54,015
Sebastian.

617
01:11:54,684 --> 01:11:57,255
I like a man that stays put.

618
01:11:58,764 --> 01:12:01,927
You live here all by yourself. do you?

619
01:12:02,124 --> 01:12:03,091
Yes.

620
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:16,445
How about some breakfast?

621
01:12:16,644 --> 01:12:18,487
I was just gonna make some.

622
01:12:18,684 --> 01:12:19,651
Excuse me.

623
01:12:26,764 --> 01:12:28,289
Well?

624
01:12:30,484 --> 01:12:31,645
Leon...

625
01:12:31,844 --> 01:12:33,733
What's going on?

626
01:12:37,884 --> 01:12:39,488
There's only two of us now.

627
01:12:41,644 --> 01:12:44,568
Then we're stupid and we'll die.

628
01:12:48,484 --> 01:12:50,566
No. we won't.

629
01:13:22,724 --> 01:13:23,691
No.

630
01:13:23,884 --> 01:13:26,251
Knight takes queen, see?

631
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:28,253
Won't do.

632
01:13:36,284 --> 01:13:38,286
Why are you staring at us. Sebastian?

633
01:13:38,484 --> 01:13:39,770
Because...

634
01:13:39,964 --> 01:13:42,012
...you're so different.

635
01:13:43,524 --> 01:13:45,492
You're so perfect.

636
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:50,052
Yes.

637
01:13:50,244 --> 01:13:52,246
What generation are you?

638
01:14:00,084 --> 01:14:01,210
Nexus 6.

639
01:14:02,244 --> 01:14:03,530
I knew it.

640
01:14:03,724 --> 01:14:06,807
Because I do genetic design work
for the Tyrell Corporation.

641
01:14:07,004 --> 01:14:09,086
There's some of me in you.

642
01:14:10,164 --> 01:14:11,814
Show me something.

643
01:14:12,004 --> 01:14:13,654
Like what?

644
01:14:13,844 --> 01:14:15,653
Like anything.

645
01:14:17,444 --> 01:14:22,006
We're no computers, Sebastian.
We're physical.

646
01:14:23,764 --> 01:14:25,892
I think. Sebastian...

647
01:14:26,084 --> 01:14:28,371
...therefore. I am.

648
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:31,693
Very good. Pris. Now show him why.

649
01:14:57,524 --> 01:14:59,174
We've got a lot in common.

650
01:14:59,364 --> 01:15:01,492
- What do you mean?
- Similar problems.

651
01:15:01,684 --> 01:15:04,335
Accelerated decrepitude.

652
01:15:06,164 --> 01:15:08,815
I don't know much about bio-mechanics.
Roy. I wish I did.

653
01:15:10,844 --> 01:15:13,211
If we don't find help soon...

654
01:15:13,404 --> 01:15:16,169
...Pris hasn't got long to live.

655
01:15:16,364 --> 01:15:18,014
We can't allow that.

656
01:15:20,164 --> 01:15:23,213
- Is he good?
- Who?

657
01:15:23,404 --> 01:15:26,613
- Your opponent.
- Oh. Dr. Tyrell?

658
01:15:26,804 --> 01:15:30,092
I've only beaten him once in chess.
He's a genius.

659
01:15:32,284 --> 01:15:33,251
He designed you.

660
01:15:35,604 --> 01:15:38,050
Maybe he could help.

661
01:15:38,244 --> 01:15:40,645
I'd be happy to mention it to him.

662
01:15:42,684 --> 01:15:46,006
Better if I talk to him in person.

663
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:53,845
But I understand
he's a sort of hard man to get to.

664
01:15:54,044 --> 01:15:55,887
Yes.

665
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:57,609
Very.

666
01:16:00,444 --> 01:16:02,731
Will you help us?

667
01:16:03,444 --> 01:16:04,684
I can't.

668
01:16:04,884 --> 01:16:06,773
We need you, Sebastian.

669
01:16:06,964 --> 01:16:09,695
You're our best and only friend.

670
01:16:22,204 --> 01:16:24,525
We're so happy you found us.

671
01:16:26,324 --> 01:16:28,292
I don't think
there's another human being...

672
01:16:28,484 --> 01:16:30,646
...in the whole world
who would've helped us.

673
01:17:17,644 --> 01:17:21,046
66.000 Presser & Ankovich.

674
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:23,569
Trade.

675
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:26,370
- Trade at two--
- Blue entry.

676
01:17:27,364 --> 01:17:30,573
A Mr. J.F. Sebastian.

677
01:17:30,764 --> 01:17:34,655
16417.

678
01:17:35,444 --> 01:17:37,094
At this hour?

679
01:17:37,284 --> 01:17:40,288
What can I do for you, Sebastian?

680
01:17:43,324 --> 01:17:44,735
Queen to bishop six. Check.

681
01:17:50,164 --> 01:17:52,212
Nonsense.

682
01:17:52,404 --> 01:17:54,532
Just a moment.

683
01:17:57,364 --> 01:18:01,847
Queen to bishop six. ridiculous.

684
01:18:07,284 --> 01:18:08,934
Queen...

685
01:18:10,524 --> 01:18:12,447
...bishop six.

686
01:18:17,364 --> 01:18:19,605
Knight...

687
01:18:19,804 --> 01:18:21,932
...takes queen.

688
01:18:28,524 --> 01:18:30,765
What's on your mind. Sebastian?

689
01:18:30,964 --> 01:18:32,329
What are you thinking about?

690
01:18:33,924 --> 01:18:36,006
Bishop to king seven.

691
01:18:36,204 --> 01:18:38,127
Checkmate.

692
01:18:38,324 --> 01:18:40,247
Bishop to king seven.
Checkmate. I think.

693
01:18:42,044 --> 01:18:45,127
Got a brainstorm. huh. Sebastian?

694
01:18:45,324 --> 01:18:48,089
Milk and cookies kept you awake, huh?

695
01:18:48,284 --> 01:18:50,332
Let's discuss this.

696
01:18:50,524 --> 01:18:52,413
You better come up, Sebastian.

697
01:19:09,364 --> 01:19:11,207
Mr. Tyrell?

698
01:19:12,924 --> 01:19:14,528
L...

699
01:19:14,724 --> 01:19:16,533
I brought a friend.

700
01:19:22,564 --> 01:19:26,364
I'm surprised
you didn't come here sooner.

701
01:19:32,804 --> 01:19:35,774
It's not an easy thing
to meet your maker.

702
01:19:36,524 --> 01:19:39,289
And what can he do for you?

703
01:19:40,044 --> 01:19:43,366
Can the maker repair what he makes?

704
01:19:43,564 --> 01:19:46,727
Would you like to be modified?

705
01:19:46,924 --> 01:19:48,767
Stay here.

706
01:19:53,724 --> 01:19:56,967
Had in mind something
a little more radical.

707
01:19:57,564 --> 01:19:59,453
What...?

708
01:19:59,644 --> 01:20:02,011
What seems to be the problem?

709
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:04,844
- Death.
- Death.

710
01:20:05,524 --> 01:20:08,448
Well. I'm afraid that's
a little out of my jurisdiction. You--

711
01:20:08,644 --> 01:20:11,454
I want more life...

712
01:20:11,644 --> 01:20:12,850
...fucker.

713
01:20:17,564 --> 01:20:19,612
The facts of life.

714
01:20:21,004 --> 01:20:23,655
To make an alteration in the...

715
01:20:23,844 --> 01:20:26,131
...evolvement of
an organic life system is fatal.

716
01:20:26,324 --> 01:20:29,726
A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.

717
01:20:29,924 --> 01:20:30,891
Why not?

718
01:20:31,084 --> 01:20:32,973
Because by the second day
of incubation...

719
01:20:33,164 --> 01:20:37,453
...any cells that have undergone
reversion mutations...

720
01:20:37,644 --> 01:20:41,694
...give rise to revertant colonies
like rats leaving a sinking ship.

721
01:20:41,884 --> 01:20:43,568
Then the ship sinks.

722
01:20:43,764 --> 01:20:47,132
What about EMS recombination?

723
01:20:47,324 --> 01:20:48,769
We've already tried it.

724
01:20:48,964 --> 01:20:53,049
Ethyl methane sulfonate is
an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen.

725
01:20:53,244 --> 01:20:57,169
It created a virus so lethal the...

726
01:20:57,364 --> 01:20:59,412
...subject was dead
before he left the table.

727
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:02,528
Then a repressor protein
that blocks the operating cells.

728
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:06,490
Wouldn't obstruct replication. but it
does give rise to an error in replication.

729
01:21:06,684 --> 01:21:11,167
So that the newly formed DNA strand
carries a mutation...

730
01:21:11,364 --> 01:21:14,095
...and you've got a virus again.

731
01:21:14,284 --> 01:21:18,528
But this. all of this. is...

732
01:21:18,724 --> 01:21:20,214
...academic.

733
01:21:20,404 --> 01:21:22,771
You were made
as well as we could make you.

734
01:21:22,964 --> 01:21:24,614
But not to last.

735
01:21:25,404 --> 01:21:28,453
The light that burns twice as bright
burns half as long.

736
01:21:28,644 --> 01:21:32,649
And you have burned
so very. very brightly. Roy.

737
01:21:33,284 --> 01:21:34,934
Look at you.

738
01:21:35,124 --> 01:21:37,525
You're the prodigal son.

739
01:21:37,724 --> 01:21:41,092
You're quite a prize.

740
01:21:46,524 --> 01:21:47,969
I've done...

741
01:21:48,164 --> 01:21:49,689
...questionable things.

742
01:21:49,884 --> 01:21:51,693
Also extraordinary things.

743
01:21:52,284 --> 01:21:54,571
Revel in your time.

744
01:21:58,364 --> 01:22:02,688
Nothing the god of biomechanics
wouldn't let you in heaven for.

745
01:23:43,285 --> 01:23:47,847
Body identified with Tyrell
is a 25-year-old male Caucasian.

746
01:23:48,045 --> 01:23:50,730
Name: Sebastian, J.F. Sebastian.

747
01:23:50,925 --> 01:23:55,567
Address: Bradbury Apartments,
Ninth Sector, NF46751.

748
01:23:55,765 --> 01:23:57,290
I want you to go down there and--

749
01:24:01,205 --> 01:24:04,049
This sector's closed to ground traffic.
What're you doing here?

750
01:24:04,245 --> 01:24:07,772
- I'm working. What are you doing?
- Arresting you, that's what I'm doing.

751
01:24:07,965 --> 01:24:12,448
I'm Deckard. Blade Runner.
26354. I'm filed and monitored.

752
01:24:12,645 --> 01:24:13,806
Hold on. Checking.

753
01:24:17,845 --> 01:24:21,372
Okay. Checked and cleared.
Have a better one.

754
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:33,414
- Hello.
- Hi. ls J.F. there?

755
01:24:33,605 --> 01:24:36,848
- Who is it?
- This is Eddie. old friend of J.F.'s.

756
01:24:40,605 --> 01:24:42,209
That's no way to treat a friend.

757
01:27:33,525 --> 01:27:35,448
Home again. home again. jiggidy-jig.

758
01:27:36,605 --> 01:27:39,415
Good evening. J.F.

759
01:27:49,205 --> 01:27:50,934
Tea?

760
01:27:52,205 --> 01:27:53,934
Mare tea?

761
01:27:55,005 --> 01:27:55,972
Tea?

762
01:28:05,165 --> 01:28:07,213
Mare tea?

763
01:28:09,125 --> 01:28:10,775
Tea?

764
01:28:12,325 --> 01:28:14,089
Mare tea?

765
01:28:15,685 --> 01:28:17,528
Mare tea?

766
01:28:29,445 --> 01:28:31,209
Mare tea?

767
01:31:29,366 --> 01:31:32,927
Not very sporting to fire
on an unarmed opponent.

768
01:31:34,446 --> 01:31:37,689
I thought you were
supposed to be good.

769
01:31:38,966 --> 01:31:41,492
Aren't you the good man?

770
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:49,608
Come on. Deckard.

771
01:31:50,806 --> 01:31:52,570
Show me...

772
01:31:53,406 --> 01:31:55,408
...what you're made of.

773
01:32:06,966 --> 01:32:08,730
Proud of yourself, little man?

774
01:32:16,326 --> 01:32:18,055
This is for Zhora.

775
01:32:19,606 --> 01:32:20,846
This is for Pris.

776
01:32:27,766 --> 01:32:29,177
Come on. Deckard.

777
01:32:29,726 --> 01:32:32,775
I'm right here.
but you've gotta shoot straight.

778
01:32:34,126 --> 01:32:36,333
Straight doesn't seem
to be good enough!

779
01:32:36,526 --> 01:32:37,527
Now it's my turn.

780
01:32:39,366 --> 01:32:42,893
I'm gonna give you a few seconds
before I come.

781
01:32:43,646 --> 01:32:44,807
One.

782
01:32:45,006 --> 01:32:47,134
Two.

783
01:32:58,606 --> 01:33:00,370
Three.

784
01:33:00,566 --> 01:33:02,375
Four.

785
01:33:14,206 --> 01:33:15,776
Pris.

786
01:34:23,486 --> 01:34:27,650
I'm coming.

787
01:34:27,846 --> 01:34:29,530
Deckard!

788
01:34:31,886 --> 01:34:33,092
Four, five

789
01:34:36,246 --> 01:34:39,250
How to stay alive?

790
01:35:01,246 --> 01:35:02,771
I can see you!

791
01:35:27,606 --> 01:35:29,734
Not yet!

792
01:35:29,926 --> 01:35:30,893
Not...

793
01:36:12,927 --> 01:36:14,053
Yes.

794
01:36:21,447 --> 01:36:22,858
You better get it up.

795
01:36:23,487 --> 01:36:24,932
Or I'm gonna have to kill you.

796
01:36:25,967 --> 01:36:28,095
Unless you're alive, you can't play.

797
01:36:28,287 --> 01:36:30,130
And if you don't play...

798
01:36:39,407 --> 01:36:41,489
Six, seven

799
01:36:41,687 --> 01:36:43,496
Go to hell or go to heaven

800
01:36:50,687 --> 01:36:52,291
Good. that's the spirit!

801
01:37:31,967 --> 01:37:34,015
That hurt.

802
01:37:37,207 --> 01:37:39,209
That was irrational of you.

803
01:37:41,127 --> 01:37:42,367
Not to mention...

804
01:37:43,007 --> 01:37:45,248
...unsportsmanlike.

805
01:37:49,007 --> 01:37:51,055
Where are you going?

806
01:40:59,207 --> 01:41:02,893
Quite an experience to live in fear.
Isn't it?

807
01:41:04,567 --> 01:41:07,457
That's what it is to be a slave.

808
01:42:03,967 --> 01:42:05,173
In
xx

809
01:42:05,367 --> 01:42:10,168
...seen things
you people wouldn't believe.

810
01:42:11,727 --> 01:42:16,654
Attack ships on fire
off the shoulder of Orion.

811
01:42:18,527 --> 01:42:20,734
I watched C-beams...

812
01:42:20,967 --> 01:42:24,449
...glitter in the dark
near the Tannhäuser Gate.

813
01:42:28,487 --> 01:42:30,410
All those...

814
01:42:30,607 --> 01:42:33,497
...moments will be lost...

815
01:42:33,687 --> 01:42:35,815
...in time...

816
01:42:37,327 --> 01:42:39,455
...like...

817
01:42:39,647 --> 01:42:41,297
...tears...

818
01:42:42,687 --> 01:42:44,815
...in rain.

819
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:50,733
Time to die.

820
01:43:18,527 --> 01:43:21,576
I don't know why he saved my life.

821
01:43:22,247 --> 01:43:26,935
Maybe in those last moments, he loved
life more than he ever had before.

822
01:43:27,127 --> 01:43:31,212
Not just his life. Anybody's life.

823
01:43:31,847 --> 01:43:33,611
My life.

824
01:43:34,367 --> 01:43:38,133
AH he'd wanted were the same answers
the rest of us want.

825
01:43:38,567 --> 01:43:40,376
Where do I come from?

826
01:43:40,567 --> 01:43:42,376
Where am I going?

827
01:43:42,567 --> 01:43:45,173
How long have I got?

828
01:43:45,807 --> 01:43:48,936
AH I could do was sit there
and watch him die.

829
01:43:54,007 --> 01:43:56,772
You've done a man's job. sir.

830
01:44:02,247 --> 01:44:04,488
I guess you're through. huh?

831
01:44:06,487 --> 01:44:08,171
Finished.

832
01:44:29,327 --> 01:44:32,171
It's too bad she won't live.

833
01:44:33,167 --> 01:44:35,534
But then again. who does?

834
01:45:07,807 --> 01:45:09,571
Rachael?

835
01:45:17,007 --> 01:45:18,611
Rachael?

836
01:45:31,967 --> 01:45:33,457
Rachael?

837
01:46:37,487 --> 01:46:39,171
Do you love me?

838
01:46:40,287 --> 01:46:41,937
I love you.

839
01:46:42,807 --> 01:46:44,571
Do you trust me?

840
01:46:45,767 --> 01:46:47,610
I trust you.

841
01:46:56,807 --> 01:46:58,252
Rachael?

842
01:47:36,247 --> 01:47:38,978
It's too bad she won't live.

843
01:47:39,167 --> 01:47:41,647
But then again, who does?

844
01:48:12,287 --> 01:48:15,575
Gaff had been there and let her live.

845
01:48:15,767 --> 01:48:19,169
Four years, he figured.
He was wrong.

846
01:48:20,247 --> 01:48:25,572
Tyrell had told me Rachael was special.
No termination date.

847
01:48:26,007 --> 01:48:29,295
I didn't know how long
we'd have together.

848
01:48:29,967 --> 01:48:31,731
Who does?
