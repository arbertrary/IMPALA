1    TITLE SEQUENCE

     In darkness, a blood-curdling cacophony:  the squeal
     of unoiled winches, the rasp of hooks and razors
     being sharpened; and worse, the howl of tormented
     souls.  Above this din one particular victim yells
     for mercy - a mixture of tears and roars of rage.

     By degrees his incoherent pleas are drowned out by
     the surrounding tumult, until without warning his
     voice pierces the confusion afresh - this time
     reduced to naked scream.

     And with the sound, an image.

     A house:  NUMBER 55, LODOVICO STREET, an old, three
     storey, late Victorian house, with gaunt trees lining
     its overgrown garden.  Its curtains are drawn, there
     is newspaper over its top window.  The titles begin
     to run, as we approach the house down the driveway.

     We move inside, to the hallway.  The cries are
     louder now.

     Room by room, we explore the empty house, while the
     titles continue to run.  It has been left empty for
     many years, though much of its furniture remains,
     covered in dust-sheets.  On the mantelpiece of one room,
     a plaster saint.  In the kitchen, evidence of life
     here.  Opened tins; bread; bottles of spirits; a
     glass.

     We move upstairs, gliding along the corridor of the
     lower landing.  The din is furious now.  On the
     floor of one room, a makeshift bed: blankets strewn;
     an open suitcase; more liquor.

     We move up a flight and approach a room off the upper
     landing, the door of which is ajar.  The light
     within swings backwards and forwards, spilling into
     the passageway.

     As we reach the door, the screams from within halt
     abruptly.

     We can hear a bell now, which has been pealing
     steadily throughout this opening sequence.

     As we move through the door, the titles end.
