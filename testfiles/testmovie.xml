               A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...

               A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. 
               War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls 
               into infinity.

                    It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, 
                    striking from a hidden base, have won their first 
                    victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

                    During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal 
                    secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the 
                    Death Star, an armored space station with enough 
                    power to destroy an entire planet.

                    Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess 
                    Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of 
                    the stolen plans that can save her people and 
                    restore freedom to the galaxy...

               The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total 
               eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny 
               silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers 
               from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed 
               by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly 
               laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing 
               the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.

   <scene id="s1">
      <meta id="s1m1">An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2- D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic surface of an Art Deco design. Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.</meta>
      <dialogue id="s1d1" name="THREEPIO">Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness!</dialogue>
      <meta id="s1m2">Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.</meta>
      <dialogue id="s1d2" name="THREEPIO">We're doomed!</dialogue>
      <meta id="s1m3">The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that only another robot could understand.</meta>
      <dialogue id="s1d3" name="THREEPIO">There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.</dialogue>
      <meta id="s1m4">Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.</meta>
      <dialogue id="s1d4" name="THREEPIO">What's that?</dialogue>
   </scene>
   <scene id="s2">
      <meta id="s2m1">The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.</meta>
   </scene>
   <scene id="s3">
      <meta id="s3m1">The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their way into the smoke-filled corridor. In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered arms and faces. An explosion hits near the robots.</meta>
      <dialogue id="s3d1" name="THREEPIO">I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...</dialogue>
      <meta id="s3m2">Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages around the two hapless robots.</meta>

   <scene id="s4">
      <meta id="s4m1">A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with a prize-winning smile. A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions. A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the tiny robot to follow him.</meta>
      <dialogue id="s4d1" name="LUKE">Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Get in gear!</dialogue>
      <meta id="s4m2">The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly.</meta>
   </scene>
   <scene id="s5">
      <meta id="s5m1">The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run in a frenzied panic.</meta>

   <scene id="s6">
      <meta id="s6m1">A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome. Artoo makes beeping sounds.</meta>
   </scene>
   <scene id="s7">
      <meta id="s7m1">Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel soldiers can be heard in the distance.</meta>
      <dialogue id="s7d1" name="THREEPIO">Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?</dialogue>
      <meta id="s7m2">A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke- filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little robot joins his companion.</meta>
      <dialogue id="s7d2" name="THREEPIO">At last! Where have you been?</dialogue>
      <meta id="s7m3">Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.</meta>
      <dialogue id="s7d3" name="THREEPIO">They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what!</dialogue>
      <meta id="s7m4">Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the subhallway. Threepio chases after him.</meta>
      <dialogue id="s7d4" name="THREEPIO">Wait a minute, where are you going?</dialogue>
      <meta id="s7m5">Artoo responds with electronic beeps.</meta>
