1
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,256
Our pasta this evening is squid ravioli
in a lemongrass broth

2
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,256
with goat cheese profiteroles,

3
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,632
and I also have an arugula caesar salad.

4
00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:07,132
For entrées this evening, I have
swordfish meatloafwith onion marmalade,

5
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:09,090
rare-roasted partridge breast
in raspberry coulis

6
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:10,423
with a sorrel timbale...

7
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:13,590
And grilled free-range rabbit
with herbed French fries.

8
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,381
Our pasta tonight is a squid
in a lemonrass broth

9
00:02:17,424 --> 00:02:20,049
and the fish tonight is grilled

10
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:22,007
With a double espresso.

11
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:24,757
God, I hate this place.
It's a chicks' restaurant.

12
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:26,673
Why aren'twe at Dorsia?

13
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:28,757
Because Bateman
won't give the maitre d' head.

14
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:33,465
Is that Reed Robinson over there?

15
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:35,423
Are you freebasing orwhat?
That's not Robinson.

16
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:38,256
- Well, who is it, then?
- It's Paul Allen.

17
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:41,090
That's not Paul Allen.
Paul Allen's on the other side of the room.

18
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:42,757
- Overthere.
- Who's he with?

19
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:44,173
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

20
00:02:44,257 --> 00:02:46,090
They don't have
a good bathroom to do coke in.

21
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:47,757
Are you sure that's Paul Allen over there?

22
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:49,049
Yes, McDufus, I am.

23
00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:50,423
He's handling the Fisher account.

24
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:51,590
Lucky bastard.

25
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:53,090
Lucky Jew bastard.

26
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:56,090
Jesus, McDermott, what does
that have to do with anything?

27
00:02:56,174 --> 00:02:57,590
I've seen that bastard sitting in his office,

28
00:02:57,633 --> 00:03:00,256
talking on the phone to the CEO,
spinning a fucking menorah.

29
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:02,840
Not a menorah. You spin a dreidel.

30
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:04,423
Oh, my God, Bateman.

31
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:07,924
Want me to fry you up some fucking
potato pancakes? Some latkes?

32
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:11,673
No, just cool itwith
the anti-Semitic remarks.

33
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:15,924
Oh, I'd forgotten.
Bateman's dating someone from the ACLU.

34
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:18,799
He's the voice of reason.
The boy next door.

35
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:21,340
Speaking of reasonable.

36
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:22,423
Only $570.

37
00:03:23,674 --> 00:03:25,423
Not bad.

38
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:27,256
A little something for the purse.

39
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:28,757
Give herthe 50.

40
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:10,256
Two Stolis on the rocks.

41
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:13,507
These aren't good anymore. It's a cash bar.

42
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:16,256
That'll be $25.

43
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:21,507
You're a fucking ugly bitch.

44
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:24,048
I want to stab you to death,

45
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,799
then play around with your blood.

46
00:04:37,758 --> 00:04:39,715
What can I get for you two?

47
00:05:04,674 --> 00:05:06,381
I live in the American Gardens building

48
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:09,173
on West 81st Street, on the 11th floor.

49
00:05:10,257 --> 00:05:14,298
My name is Patrick Bateman.
I'm 27 years old.

50
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:17,757
I believe in taking care of myself

51
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,632
and a balanced diet

52
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:22,423
and a rigorous exercise routine.

53
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:25,340
In the morning, if my face is a little puffy,

54
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:28,715
I'll put on an ice pack while
doing my stomach crunches.

55
00:05:28,758 --> 00:05:31,131
I can do 1,000 now.

56
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:51,924
After I remove the ice pack,
I use a deep-pore cleanser lotion.

57
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:55,256
In the shower,
I use a water-activated gel cleanser,

58
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,924
then a honey-almond body scrub,

59
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:03,964
and on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub.

60
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:15,715
Then I apply an herb mint facial mask,

61
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:17,757
which I leave on for 10 minutes,

62
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,590
while I prepare the rest of my routine.

63
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,423
I always use an aftershave lotion

64
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:26,507
with little or no alcohol,

65
00:06:26,591 --> 00:06:28,590
because alcohol dries yourface out

66
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:30,256
and makes you look older.

67
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:32,298
Then moisturizer,

68
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:34,423
then an anti-aging eye balm

69
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:37,923
followed by a final
moisturizing protective lotion.

70
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,590
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman,

71
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:44,590
some kind of abstraction,

72
00:06:44,674 --> 00:06:46,799
but there is no real me,

73
00:06:46,883 --> 00:06:49,964
only an entity, something illusory.

74
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:52,340
And though I can hide my cold gaze

75
00:06:52,424 --> 00:06:55,673
and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh gripping yours,

76
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:57,548
and maybe you can even sense

77
00:06:57,591 --> 00:07:00,256
our lifestyles are probably comparable,

78
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:04,256
I simply am not there.

79
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,256
Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.

80
00:07:37,882 --> 00:07:40,590
- Late.
- Aerobics class, sorry. Any messages?

81
00:07:40,674 --> 00:07:42,298
Ricky Harrison has to cancel.

82
00:07:42,382 --> 00:07:44,298
He didn't saywhat
he was canceling orwhy.

83
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:47,881
I occasionally boxwith Ricky
at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?

84
00:07:47,924 --> 00:07:50,590
Spencerwants to meet for drinks
at Flutie's Pier 17.

85
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:52,089
- When?
- After 6.00.

86
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:54,340
- Negative. Cancel it.
- And what should I say?

87
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:55,632
Just say no.

88
00:07:55,716 --> 00:07:58,298
Just say no?

89
00:07:58,382 --> 00:08:03,089
Okay, Jean, I need reservations
forthree at Camols at 12:30,

90
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:05,423
and if not there, try Crayons, all right?

91
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:07,256
Yes, sir.

92
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:10,298
Oh, wait, and I need reservations fortwo

93
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:13,465
atArcadia at 8:00 on Thursday.

94
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:15,089
Something romantic?

95
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:16,923
No.

96
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:19,757
Silly.

97
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:21,381
Forget it, I'll make them.

98
00:08:21,424 --> 00:08:23,256
- No, I'll do it.
- No, no.

99
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:26,590
Be a doll and just get me
a mineral water, okay?

100
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,590
You look nice today.

101
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,340
Don'twearthat outfit again.

102
00:08:30,424 --> 00:08:31,757
What? I didn't hear you.

103
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,089
I said, do notwearthat outfit again.

104
00:08:34,132 --> 00:08:36,173
Wear a dress, a skirt or something.

105
00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:38,923
You don't like this, I take it?

106
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:41,507
Come on, you're prettierthan that.

107
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:43,256
Thanks, Patrick.

108
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:45,340
I'm not here.

109
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:48,423
And high heels. I like high heels.

110
00:08:57,257 --> 00:08:59,006
"Feathered Friends" for 600.

111
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,423
During courtship, the male frigate bird

112
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,923
inflates to enormous size
the red pouch found here.

113
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:20,756
Thousands of roses,

114
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,632
and lots of chocolate truffles, Godiva,

115
00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:25,632
and oysters on the half shell.

116
00:09:25,716 --> 00:09:28,632
I'm trying to listen to the
new Robert Palmertape,

117
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:30,798
but Evelyn, my supposed fiancée,

118
00:09:30,882 --> 00:09:33,089
keeps buzzing in my ear.

119
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:36,673
Annie Leibovitz. We'll getAnnie Leibovitz.

120
00:09:36,757 --> 00:09:39,632
And we'll have to get
someone to videotape.

121
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:42,756
Patrick, we should do it.

122
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,756
- Do what?
- Get married. Have a wedding.

123
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,798
No, I can't take the time offwork.

124
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:50,756
Yourfather practically owns the company.
You can do anything you like, silly.

125
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,089
I don'twant to talk about it.

126
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:55,298
You hate that job anyway.
I don't see why you just don't quit.

127
00:09:55,382 --> 00:10:00,256
Because I want to fit in.

128
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:13,048
Williams party.

129
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,381
I'm on the verge oftears
by the time we arrive at Espace,

130
00:10:16,424 --> 00:10:19,089
since I'm positive
we won't have a decent table.

131
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:20,590
But we do,

132
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:23,839
and reliefwashes over me
in an awesome wave.

133
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:28,089
Patrick, this is my cousin
Vanden and her boyfriend Stash.

134
00:10:28,132 --> 00:10:29,756
They're both artists.

135
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,089
- The menu's in Braille.
- I see you've met everyone.

136
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,089
You look awesome.

137
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:37,423
Okay, okay, all right.

138
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:43,006
I'm fairly certain that Timothy Bryce
and Evelyn are having an affair.

139
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,964
Timothy is the only
interesting person I know.

140
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:47,756
I'm almost completely indifferent

141
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,048
as to whether Evelyn knows
I'm having an affair

142
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,923
with Courtney Rawlinson,
her closest friend.

143
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:57,590
Courtney is almost perfect-looking.

144
00:10:57,673 --> 00:11:00,340
She's usually operating on
one or more psychiatric drugs.

145
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:02,423
Tonight, I believe it's Xanax.

146
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:04,340
More disturbing than her drug use, though,

147
00:11:04,424 --> 00:11:05,964
is the fact that she's engaged

148
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:09,381
to Luis Carruthers,
the biggest dufus in the business.

149
00:11:09,424 --> 00:11:11,964
Tell me, Stash,

150
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:15,423
do you think SoHo
is becoming too commercial?

151
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,131
Yes, I read that.

152
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:18,923
Oh, who gives a rat's ass?

153
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:20,964
Hey, that affects us.

154
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:23,298
What about the massacres
in Sri Lanka, honey?

155
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,548
Doesn't that affect us, too?
Do you know anything about Sri Lanka?

156
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,340
How, like, the Sikhs are, like,
killing tons of Israelis over there?

157
00:11:29,424 --> 00:11:31,089
Come on, Bryce.

158
00:11:31,174 --> 00:11:33,631
There are a lot more important
problems than Sri Lanka

159
00:11:33,715 --> 00:11:34,756
to worry about.

160
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,839
Like what?

161
00:11:35,924 --> 00:11:38,465
Well, we have to end apartheid, for one,

162
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:41,048
and slow down the nuclear arms race,

163
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,756
stop terrorism, and world hunger.

164
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,923
We have to provide food and shelter
for the homeless

165
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,798
and oppose racial discrimination
and promote civil rights

166
00:11:51,882 --> 00:11:54,798
while also promoting
equal rights forwomen.

167
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,256
We have to encourage a return

168
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,881
to traditional moral values.

169
00:12:00,924 --> 00:12:02,423
Most importantly,

170
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:06,881
we have to promote general social concern

171
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:09,131
and less materialism in young people.

172
00:12:11,257 --> 00:12:12,256
Patrick,

173
00:12:13,673 --> 00:12:15,173
how thought-provoking.

174
00:12:51,424 --> 00:12:56,547
Hello.

175
00:13:14,882 --> 00:13:16,756
"Bleach-ee"?
Are you trying to say "bleach-ee"?

176
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:18,839
Oh, my God. Two things.

177
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,465
One, you can't bleach a Cerruti.
Out of the question.

178
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:24,423
Two, I can only get
these sheets in Santa Fe.

179
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:27,340
These are very expensive sheets
and I really need them clean.

180
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:29,381
If you don't shutyourfucking mouth,

181
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:30,672
I will kill you.

182
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:34,215
I have a lunch meeting at Hubert's
in 20 minutes with Ronald Harrison

183
00:13:34,257 --> 00:13:37,131
and I need those sheets
cleaned by this afternoon.

184
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,756
I cannot understand you!
This is crazy. You're a fool.

185
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,798
I can't cope with this. Stupid "bitch-ee"!

186
00:13:41,882 --> 00:13:43,589
Understand? Christ.

187
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:45,173
Patrick?

188
00:13:45,757 --> 00:13:48,631
Hi, Patrick. I thought thatwas you.

189
00:13:48,715 --> 00:13:50,173
Hello...

190
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:52,256
Isn't it ridiculous coming
all the way up here?

191
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,589
But they really are the best.

192
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,798
Then why can't they get these stains out?

193
00:13:55,882 --> 00:13:59,173
Can you talk to these people or something?
I'm not getting anywhere.

194
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:00,506
Oh, what are those?

195
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,923
Oh, well, it's cranberry juice. Cran-apple.

196
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:05,423
Really?

197
00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:08,131
Listen, if you could talk to them,
I would really appreciate it.

198
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:11,381
I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment
at Hubert's in 15 minutes.

199
00:14:11,424 --> 00:14:12,839
Hubert's? That moved uptown, right?

200
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:15,672
Well, boy, listen, I've gotta go.
Thank you, Victoria.

201
00:14:15,757 --> 00:14:18,089
Maybe we could do lunch
one day nextweek.

202
00:14:18,132 --> 00:14:19,256
You know, I'm downtown...

203
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:22,672
- I don't know. I'm atwork all the time.
- What about a Saturday?

204
00:14:22,757 --> 00:14:24,173
- Next Saturday?
- Sure.

205
00:14:24,257 --> 00:14:26,547
Can't, I'm afraid.
I have a matinée of Les Mis.

206
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,256
I've really got to go. Christ. I'll call you.

207
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:31,589
Okay. Do.

208
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:33,589
Listen, you're dating Luis. He's in Arizona.

209
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:35,714
You're fucking me,
and we haven't made plans.

210
00:14:35,757 --> 00:14:37,589
What could you possibly be up to tonight?

211
00:14:37,673 --> 00:14:38,881
Stop it. I'm...

212
00:14:38,924 --> 00:14:40,506
On a lot of lithium?

213
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,340
Waiting for Luis to call me.

214
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,881
He said he'd call tonight.

215
00:14:44,423 --> 00:14:45,756
Pumpkin.

216
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,589
Pumpkin, you're dating an asshole.

217
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:51,464
Pumpkin, you're dating
the biggest dickweed in New York.

218
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,672
Pumpkin, you're dating
a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.

219
00:14:55,757 --> 00:14:58,839
Patrick, stop calling me pumpkin, okay?

220
00:14:58,924 --> 00:15:01,256
I have to go.

221
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:02,422
Courtney!

222
00:15:02,757 --> 00:15:04,964
- Dinner.
- I can't!

223
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:06,756
I'm thinking Dorsia.

224
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,298
Dorsia's nice.

225
00:15:10,382 --> 00:15:12,298
Wear something fabulous.

226
00:15:26,257 --> 00:15:27,256
Dorsia.

227
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:28,839
Yes, I know it's a little late,

228
00:15:28,924 --> 00:15:31,422
but is it possible to reserve a table fortwo

229
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:34,756
at 8:00 or 8:30, perhaps?

230
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:54,256
A facial at Elizabeth Arden,
which was really relaxing,

231
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:58,298
and then to the Pottery Barn

232
00:15:58,381 --> 00:16:02,881
where I got this little silver muffin dish.

233
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:04,547
Is that Donald Trump's car?

234
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,131
God, Patrick, shut up.

235
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,131
Courtney, you should take
some more lithium or have a Diet Coke.

236
00:16:09,216 --> 00:16:11,380
Some caffeine
might getyou out of this slump.

237
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:15,339
I just want a child.

238
00:16:15,423 --> 00:16:17,798
Just two

239
00:16:17,882 --> 00:16:19,380
perfect

240
00:16:20,423 --> 00:16:22,756
children.

241
00:16:26,924 --> 00:16:28,339
Are we here?

242
00:16:28,423 --> 00:16:29,798
Yeah.

243
00:16:36,924 --> 00:16:38,589
This is Dorsia?

244
00:16:38,673 --> 00:16:40,464
- Good evening.
- Yes, dear.

245
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:43,256
Courtney, you're gonna have
the peanut butter soup

246
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,964
with smoked duck and mashed squash.

247
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:47,839
New York Matinee called it

248
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,923
"a playful, but mysterious little dish."

249
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:51,422
You'll love it.

250
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:53,798
And then the red snapper
with violets and pine nuts.

251
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:55,756
I think thatwill follow nicely.

252
00:16:58,216 --> 00:16:59,672
Thanks, Patrick.

253
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,297
Patrick, thanks so much
for looking after Courtney.

254
00:17:09,381 --> 00:17:11,756
Dorsia, how impressive.

255
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,923
How on earth did you
get a reservation there?

256
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:15,881
Lucky, I guess.

257
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:18,256
That's a wonderful suit.

258
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,006
Don't tell me, don't tell me, let me guess.

259
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,839
Valentino Couture.

260
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:26,131
Uh-huh.

261
00:17:26,216 --> 00:17:27,672
It looks so soft.

262
00:17:27,757 --> 00:17:30,173
Your complimentwas sufficient, Luis.

263
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:34,464
Hello, Halberstram. Nice tie.

264
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:36,006
How the hell are you?

265
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,547
Allen has mistaken me forthis dickhead,
Marcus Halberstram.

266
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,255
It seems logical, because
Marcus also works at P&P

267
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,506
and, in fact, does the same exact thing I do.

268
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,589
He also has a penchant for Valentino suits
and Oliver Peoples glasses.

269
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:50,589
Marcus and I even go to the same barber,

270
00:17:50,673 --> 00:17:52,881
although I have a slightly better haircut.

271
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:54,547
So how's the Ransom account
going, Marcus?

272
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,297
- It's all right.
- Really?

273
00:17:56,381 --> 00:17:58,714
That's interesting. It's not... It's not great.

274
00:17:58,757 --> 00:17:59,923
Oh, well, you know.

275
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:02,464
So how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.

276
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,589
Oh, yeah, I'm very lucky.

277
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:07,923
Congratulations on the Fisher account.

278
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:09,255
Thank you, Baxter.

279
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,255
Listen, Paul. Squash?

280
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:16,631
Call me.

281
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:19,714
- How about Friday?
- No can do.

282
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:22,964
I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.

283
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:26,297
Great sea urchin ceviche.

284
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:28,964
Dorsia on a Friday night?
How'd he swing that?

285
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,464
I think he's lying.

286
00:18:33,673 --> 00:18:34,923
Is that a gram?

287
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:36,964
New card.

288
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,297
What do you think?

289
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:41,964
Whoa. Very nice.

290
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:43,798
Look at that.

291
00:18:43,882 --> 00:18:45,964
Picked them up from
the printer's yesterday.

292
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:48,089
- Good coloring.
- That's bone.

293
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:50,547
And the lettering is
something called Silian Rail.

294
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,422
It's very cool, Bateman.

295
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,756
But that's nothing. Look at this.

296
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,547
That is really nice.

297
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,131
Eggshell with Romalian type.

298
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,422
What do you think?

299
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,464
Nice.

300
00:19:03,757 --> 00:19:05,756
Jesus. That is really super.

301
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,089
How did a nitwit like you get so tasteful?

302
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,422
I can't believe

303
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:13,672
that Bryce prefers Van Patten's card
to mine.

304
00:19:13,757 --> 00:19:16,589
Butwait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.

305
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,714
Raised lettering. Pale Nimbus White.

306
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:26,547
Impressive. Very nice.

307
00:19:29,256 --> 00:19:31,006
Let's see Paul Allen's card.

308
00:19:45,256 --> 00:19:47,380
Look at that subtle off-white coloring,

309
00:19:48,131 --> 00:19:50,297
the tasteful thickness of it.

310
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:51,923
Oh, my God.

311
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:54,130
It even has a watermark.

312
00:19:58,507 --> 00:20:01,048
Is something wrong, Patrick?

313
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,839
You're sweating.

314
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:33,088
Hello.

315
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,088
Pat Bateman. You want some money?

316
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:38,214
Some food?

317
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:43,006
- This what you need?
- I'm hungry.

318
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:44,923
Yeah. Cold out, too, isn't it?

319
00:20:49,673 --> 00:20:50,923
Why don't you get a job?

320
00:20:50,965 --> 00:20:53,297
Ifyou're so hungry,
why don't you get a job?

321
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:55,506
I lost my job.

322
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,464
Why? You drinking?

323
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:00,255
Is thatwhy you lost it?

324
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,255
Insidertrading? Justjoking.

325
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,422
Listen, what's your name?

326
00:21:05,507 --> 00:21:06,506
Al.

327
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:08,464
Speak up. Come on.

328
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:10,798
- Al.
- Get a goddamn job, Al.

329
00:21:10,882 --> 00:21:14,006
You got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you.

330
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:16,255
You gotta get your act together.

331
00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:17,964
I'll help you.

332
00:21:18,048 --> 00:21:20,255
You are so kind, mister.

333
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:22,130
You're kind. You're a kind man.

334
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:23,506
- It's okay.
- I can tell.

335
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,130
Please, you gotta tell me what to do.

336
00:21:26,215 --> 00:21:28,339
You gotta help me. I'm so cold.

337
00:21:28,423 --> 00:21:29,923
I'm hungry.

338
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:33,214
You know how bad you smell?

339
00:21:33,256 --> 00:21:35,756
You reek of shit. Do you know that?

340
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:37,923
Al.

341
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,923
I'm sorry.

342
00:21:41,006 --> 00:21:44,214
It's just that... I don't know.

343
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:48,380
I don't have anything in common with you.

344
00:21:56,965 --> 00:22:00,464
Oh, thank you, mister. Thank you.

345
00:22:00,548 --> 00:22:01,964
I'm cold out here.

346
00:22:02,048 --> 00:22:04,964
- You know what a fucking loseryou are?
- What?

347
00:22:29,423 --> 00:22:32,297
What beautiful skin you have, Mr. Bateman.

348
00:22:32,924 --> 00:22:35,214
So fine, so smooth.

349
00:22:43,048 --> 00:22:45,589
I have all the characteristics
of a human being,

350
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:49,714
flesh, blood, skin, hair,

351
00:22:49,757 --> 00:22:52,589
but not a single clear identifiable emotion,

352
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:56,088
except for greed and disgust.

353
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,756
Something horrible
is happening inside of me,

354
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:02,297
and I don't know why.

355
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:06,339
My nightly blood lust
has overflowed into my days.

356
00:23:06,423 --> 00:23:09,922
I feel lethal, on the verge offrenzy.

357
00:23:10,006 --> 00:23:13,422
I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.

358
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:28,589
Hey, MacLoy, what do you say?

359
00:23:28,632 --> 00:23:30,963
Hey, Hamilton,
have a holly, jolly Christmas.

360
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:33,714
Is Allen still handling the Fisher account?

361
00:23:33,757 --> 00:23:35,297
Of course. Who else?

362
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:38,422
Mistletoe alert. Merry Xmas, Patrick.

363
00:23:38,507 --> 00:23:40,756
- Merry Xmas, Harry.
- Merry Christmas.

364
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,714
- You're late, honey.
- I'm not late.

365
00:23:42,757 --> 00:23:45,005
- Oh, yes, you are.
- I've been here the entire time.

366
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:46,798
You just didn't see me.

367
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:48,088
Say hello to Snowball.

368
00:23:48,131 --> 00:23:50,589
Snowball says "Merry Christmas, Patrick."

369
00:23:51,215 --> 00:23:52,255
What is it?

370
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:54,130
It's a little baby piggy-wiggy, isn't it?

371
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:56,714
It's a Vietnamese potbellied pig.

372
00:23:56,757 --> 00:23:59,088
They make darling pets. Don't you?

373
00:23:59,131 --> 00:24:00,839
Don't you?

374
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:04,589
Stop scowling, Patrick.
You're such a Grinch.

375
00:24:04,632 --> 00:24:06,880
What does Mr. Grinch want for Christmas?

376
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:09,339
And don't say "breast implants" again.

377
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,380
Alan.

378
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:14,756
Marcus! Merry Christmas.

379
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,880
How you been? Workaholic, I suppose?

380
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:18,922
I haven't seen you in a while.

381
00:24:18,964 --> 00:24:22,088
Hey, Hamilton! We're going to Nell's.
Limo's out front.

382
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:23,756
We should have dinner.

383
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,130
Maybe you could bring...

384
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,422
- Cecilia?
- Yes, Cecilia!

385
00:24:28,465 --> 00:24:30,756
Oh, Cecilia would adore it.

386
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:33,255
Well, then let's do it, Marcus.

387
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:35,380
- Great party.
- Thanks.

388
00:24:35,423 --> 00:24:38,672
Patrick, why is he calling you Marcus?

389
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:40,589
Mistletoe alert.

390
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,756
Marcus Halberstram fortwo at 7.00.

391
00:24:52,964 --> 00:24:54,631
No, I want to know.

392
00:24:55,048 --> 00:24:57,255
I came here for
the cilantro crawfish gumbo. All right?

393
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,838
Which is, after all, the only excuse
one could have for being in this restaurant,

394
00:25:00,923 --> 00:25:03,255
which is, by the way,
almost completely empty.

395
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,838
- I'm very sorry, sir.
- J&B straight and a Corona.

396
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:09,297
- Would you like to hear...
- Double Absolut martini.

397
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:12,297
Yes, sir.
Would you like to hearthe specials?

398
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:15,172
Not if you want to keep your spleen.

399
00:25:17,423 --> 00:25:20,589
This is a real beehive
of activity, Halberstram.

400
00:25:20,673 --> 00:25:22,797
This place is hot. Very hot.

401
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:26,672
Listen, the mud soup and charcoal arugula
are outrageous here.

402
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:28,714
Yeah, well, you're late.

403
00:25:28,757 --> 00:25:32,297
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break.

404
00:25:32,381 --> 00:25:35,297
I see they've omitted
the pork loin with lime Jell-o.

405
00:25:35,381 --> 00:25:36,797
We should've gone to Dorsia.

406
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:38,922
I could have gotten us a table.

407
00:25:38,964 --> 00:25:41,172
Nobody goes there anymore.

408
00:25:42,256 --> 00:25:45,088
Is that Ivana Trump?

409
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:48,047
Oh, jeez, Patrick... I mean, Marcus,

410
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:49,422
what are you thinking?

411
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,214
Whywould Ivana be at Texarkana?

412
00:25:52,923 --> 00:25:56,464
So, wasn't Rothschild
originally handling the Fisher account?

413
00:25:56,548 --> 00:25:57,963
How'd you get it?

414
00:25:58,048 --> 00:26:01,797
Well, I could tell you that, Halberstram,

415
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:04,088
but then I'd have to kill you.

416
00:26:10,756 --> 00:26:12,714
I like to dissect girls.

417
00:26:12,756 --> 00:26:14,589
Did you know I'm utterly insane?

418
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,922
Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive.

419
00:26:19,964 --> 00:26:21,755
- Where do you tan?
- Salon.

420
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:24,797
I've got a tanning bed at home.
You should look into it.

421
00:26:26,256 --> 00:26:28,422
And Cecilia... How is she?

422
00:26:28,507 --> 00:26:29,838
Where is she tonight?

423
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:32,130
Cecilia is... Well, you know Cecilia.

424
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:36,339
I think she's having dinner
with Evelyn Williams.

425
00:26:36,423 --> 00:26:38,506
Evelyn! Great ass.

426
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,088
Goes outwith that loser Patrick Bateman.

427
00:26:41,131 --> 00:26:43,506
What a dork.

428
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,464
Another martini, Paul?

429
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,130
You like Huey Lewis and the News?

430
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,589
They're okay.

431
00:26:57,423 --> 00:27:01,755
Their earlywork was
a little too newwave for my taste.

432
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,922
Butwhen Sports came out in '83,

433
00:27:03,964 --> 00:27:07,339
I think they really came into their own,
commercially and artistically.

434
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,297
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound

435
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,255
and a new sheen of
consummate professionalism

436
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:19,339
that really gives the songs a big boost.

437
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:30,755
He's been compared to Elvis Costello,

438
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:32,797
but I think Huey has a far more bitter,

439
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:35,755
cynical sense of humor.

440
00:27:35,798 --> 00:27:37,755
- Hey, Halberstram.
- Yes, Allen?

441
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:41,713
Why are there copies of the Style section
all over the place?

442
00:27:41,756 --> 00:27:43,631
Do you have a dog?

443
00:27:43,714 --> 00:27:45,631
A little chow or something?

444
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:47,088
No, Allen.

445
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:48,755
Is that a raincoat?

446
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:50,922
Yes, it is!

447
00:27:51,006 --> 00:27:53,880
In '87, Huey released this,

448
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,589
Fore!, their most accomplished album.

449
00:27:55,631 --> 00:27:59,130
I think their undisputed masterpiece
is Hip to be Square.

450
00:27:59,215 --> 00:28:02,922
The song's so catchy. Most people
probably don't listen to the lyrics.

451
00:28:02,964 --> 00:28:04,922
But they should because it's not just about

452
00:28:05,006 --> 00:28:07,755
the pleasures of conformity
and the importance oftrends,

453
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,755
it's also a personal statement
about the band itself.

454
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:11,963
Hey, Paul?

455
00:28:18,006 --> 00:28:20,755
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now,

456
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:23,255
you fucking stupid bastard!

457
00:28:25,923 --> 00:28:29,172
You fucking bastard!

458
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:32,963
'Cause I can tell
what's going on

459
00:28:33,048 --> 00:28:35,088
It's hip to be square

460
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:44,506
I like my bands in business suits

461
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:47,922
I watch them on TV

462
00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:50,922
I'm working out 'most every day

463
00:28:50,964 --> 00:28:53,214
And watching what I eat

464
00:28:54,714 --> 00:28:57,713
They tell me that it's good for me

465
00:28:57,756 --> 00:29:01,255
But I don't even care

466
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:03,005
I know that it's crazy

467
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:04,713
I know that it's nowhere

468
00:29:04,756 --> 00:29:07,172
There is no denying that

469
00:29:07,256 --> 00:29:09,380
It's hip to be square

470
00:29:27,547 --> 00:29:29,588
He was completely naked
and he was standing

471
00:29:29,672 --> 00:29:32,297
on one of the tables
with everyone watching...

472
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:35,713
Patrick? Patrick!

473
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:37,671
Is thatyou?

474
00:29:37,756 --> 00:29:41,047
No, Luis, it's not me. You're mistaken.

475
00:29:41,089 --> 00:29:43,214
This is my very good friend,
Patrick Bateman.

476
00:29:43,256 --> 00:29:46,172
Where are you going?
We're going to Nell's.

477
00:29:46,256 --> 00:29:48,588
Gwendolyn's father is buying it.

478
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:54,588
Where did you get that overnight bag?

479
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:58,255
Jean Paul Gaultier.

480
00:30:09,589 --> 00:30:11,630
When I get to Paul Allen's place,

481
00:30:11,714 --> 00:30:15,671
I use the keys I took from his pocket
before disposing of the body.

482
00:30:15,756 --> 00:30:18,755
There is a moment of sheer panic

483
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,963
when I realize that Paul's apartment
overlooks the park

484
00:30:23,048 --> 00:30:26,047
and it's obviously
more expensive than mine.

485
00:30:29,173 --> 00:30:31,922
I calm myself and move into the bedroom,

486
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:35,130
where I find his suitcase and start to pack.

487
00:30:35,215 --> 00:30:38,088
It's time for Paul to take a little trip.

488
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,047
Where to send the bastard?

489
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:45,130
Dallas?

490
00:30:45,215 --> 00:30:47,755
Paris? Singapore?

491
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:50,088
London. I'll send the ass to London.

492
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,922
Hi, this is Paul.

493
00:30:59,964 --> 00:31:01,755
I've been called away
to London for a few days.

494
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:03,588
Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.

495
00:31:03,881 --> 00:31:05,546
Hasta la vista, baby.

496
00:31:30,547 --> 00:31:32,047
What is it?

497
00:31:32,631 --> 00:31:33,630
Patrick.

498
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:36,255
Yes, Jean?

499
00:31:36,298 --> 00:31:38,630
There's a Mr. Donald Kimball
here to see you.

500
00:31:38,714 --> 00:31:39,838
Who?

501
00:31:39,923 --> 00:31:42,047
Detective Donald Kimball.

502
00:31:46,298 --> 00:31:48,421
Tell him I'm at lunch.

503
00:31:48,464 --> 00:31:51,755
Patrick, it's only 10:30.
I think he knows you're here.

504
00:31:52,631 --> 00:31:54,630
Send him in, I guess.

505
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:05,005
Now, John, you've gotta wear clothes
in proportion to your physique.

506
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,671
There are definite dos and don'ts, good
buddy, ofwearing a bold-striped shirt.

507
00:32:09,006 --> 00:32:11,255
A bold-striped shirt calls for solid-colored

508
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:13,922
or discretely patterned suits and ties.

509
00:32:13,964 --> 00:32:17,421
Yes, always tip the stylist 15%.

510
00:32:18,089 --> 00:32:21,255
Listen, John, I've got to go.
T. Boone Pickensjustwalked in.

511
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,005
Justjoking.

512
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:25,922
No, don't tip the owner of the salon.

513
00:32:25,964 --> 00:32:28,880
Okay, John. Right. Got it.

514
00:32:29,756 --> 00:32:31,297
Sorry about that.

515
00:32:31,756 --> 00:32:33,755
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made an appointment.

516
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:35,922
Was that anything important?

517
00:32:35,964 --> 00:32:38,797
Oh, that?
Just mulling over business problems,

518
00:32:38,881 --> 00:32:41,838
examining opportunities,
exchanging rumors,

519
00:32:42,756 --> 00:32:43,838
spreading gossip.

520
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:48,130
Hi. I'm Donald Kimball.

521
00:32:48,215 --> 00:32:50,130
Hi, Pat Bateman. Nice to meetyou.

522
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:52,130
Sorry to barge in on you like this.

523
00:32:52,215 --> 00:32:54,255
I know how busy you guys can get.

524
00:32:56,756 --> 00:33:01,671
So, what's the topic of discussion?

525
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:04,088
I've been hired by Meredith Powell

526
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:06,671
to investigate the disappearance
of Paul Allen.

527
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:10,963
I see, yeah. Paul's disappearance, yeah.

528
00:33:11,048 --> 00:33:14,963
So it's nothing that official. I just have
some basic questions about Paul Allen.

529
00:33:15,048 --> 00:33:16,421
- Aboutyourself...
- Coffee?

530
00:33:16,464 --> 00:33:17,630
No, I'm okay.

531
00:33:17,714 --> 00:33:19,588
- Apollinaris?
- No, I'm okay.

532
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:23,755
- Can you bring Mister...
- Kimball.

533
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:25,296
Mr. Kimball a bottle...

534
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,797
- No, really, I'm okay.
- It's no problem.

535
00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:32,922
So, what's the topic of discussion?

536
00:33:33,006 --> 00:33:35,588
The disappearance of Paul Allen.

537
00:33:35,672 --> 00:33:36,922
Right.

538
00:33:37,006 --> 00:33:39,463
Well, I haven't...

539
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:44,172
I haven't heard anything about
the disappearance or anything,

540
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:46,421
not on Page Six at least.

541
00:33:46,464 --> 00:33:50,130
- I think his familywants this kept quiet.
- Understandable. Lime?

542
00:33:50,215 --> 00:33:54,255
- No, really, I'm okay.
- You sure? I can always getyou a lime.

543
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:57,338
Just some preliminary questions that I need
for my own files, okay?

544
00:33:57,422 --> 00:33:59,088
Shoot.

545
00:33:59,173 --> 00:34:02,172
- How old are you?
- 27.

546
00:34:02,255 --> 00:34:03,922
- Where did you go to school?
- Harvard.

547
00:34:03,964 --> 00:34:06,588
- Then Harvard Business School.
- Your address?

548
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:08,922
The American Gardens building,
West 81st Street.

549
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:10,922
Nice. Very nice.

550
00:34:10,964 --> 00:34:12,505
Thanks.

551
00:34:12,589 --> 00:34:16,254
- What can you tell me about Paul Allen?
- I'm at a loss.

552
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:18,254
He was part ofthatwhole Yale thing.

553
00:34:18,297 --> 00:34:20,463
- "Yale thing"?
- Yeah, Yale thing.

554
00:34:20,547 --> 00:34:22,130
What do you mean, "Yale thing"?

555
00:34:22,215 --> 00:34:25,797
Well, I think for one that he was
probably a closet homosexual

556
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:28,338
who did a lot of cocaine.

557
00:34:28,422 --> 00:34:30,296
That Yale thing.

558
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,214
What kind of man was he?

559
00:34:32,255 --> 00:34:34,588
Besides the information
you'vejust given me.

560
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,421
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.

561
00:34:36,506 --> 00:34:39,671
- Do you feel like that?
- No, not really.

562
00:34:41,506 --> 00:34:44,421
- Where did Paul hang out?
- Hang out?

563
00:34:44,464 --> 00:34:45,922
Yeah, you know, hang out.

564
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:48,671
Let me think. The Newport.

565
00:34:48,756 --> 00:34:51,254
Harry's. Flutie's.

566
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,838
Indochine. Nell's. The Cornell Club.

567
00:34:53,923 --> 00:34:56,296
- The New York Yacht Club.
- He had a yacht?

568
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,254
No, hejust hung out there.

569
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:00,338
And where did he go to school?

570
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:05,088
- Don't you know this?
- I just wanted to know if you know.

571
00:35:08,964 --> 00:35:11,922
Before Yale, if I remember correctly,
Saint Paul's.

572
00:35:12,006 --> 00:35:15,172
Listen, I just... I just want to help.

573
00:35:17,422 --> 00:35:18,963
I understand.

574
00:35:21,547 --> 00:35:22,880
Do you have anywitnesses orfingerprints?

575
00:35:22,923 --> 00:35:25,379
Well, there's a message
on his answering machine

576
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:26,838
that says he went to London.

577
00:35:26,923 --> 00:35:29,421
- Maybe he did, huh?
- His girlfriend doesn't think so.

578
00:35:29,506 --> 00:35:31,671
- But has anyone seen him in London?
- Actually, yes.

579
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,005
But I've had a hard time
getting actual verification.

580
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:38,671
A Stephen Hughes said he saw him
at a restaurant there.

581
00:35:38,756 --> 00:35:40,671
But I checked it out, and what happened is

582
00:35:40,756 --> 00:35:43,130
he mistook a HerbertAinsworth
for Paul, so...

583
00:35:43,214 --> 00:35:44,838
Had his apartment been burglarized?

584
00:35:44,923 --> 00:35:47,088
No, actually it hadn't.

585
00:35:47,172 --> 00:35:50,254
Toiletries were missing, a suitwas gone,
so was some luggage, that's it.

586
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:53,088
I mean, no one's dealing with
the homicide squad yet, or anything, right?

587
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:55,254
No, notyet. As I said, we're not sure.

588
00:35:55,339 --> 00:35:57,755
Basically, no one's seen or heard anything.

589
00:35:57,798 --> 00:36:00,588
- So typical, isn't it?
- It's just strange.

590
00:36:01,255 --> 00:36:03,088
One day someone's walking around,

591
00:36:03,172 --> 00:36:05,797
going to work, alive, and then...

592
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:07,296
Nothing.

593
00:36:08,255 --> 00:36:10,254
Peoplejust disappear.

594
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:14,047
The earth just opens up
and swallows them.

595
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,421
Eerie. Really eerie.

596
00:36:24,172 --> 00:36:26,088
Listen, you'll have to excuse me.

597
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,838
I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable

598
00:36:28,923 --> 00:36:31,005
at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes.

599
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:34,546
The Four Seasons?
Isn't that a little far uptown?

600
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:36,421
I mean, aren't you gonna be late?

601
00:36:36,506 --> 00:36:38,213
No, there's one down here.

602
00:36:38,255 --> 00:36:40,421
- Oh, really? I didn't know that.
- It's very good.

603
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:44,630
Listen, if anything else occurs to you,
any information...

604
00:36:44,714 --> 00:36:46,463
Absolutely. I'm 100% with you.

605
00:36:46,547 --> 00:36:51,463
Great, and thanks foryourtime,
Mr. Bateman.

606
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:57,338
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

607
00:37:56,006 --> 00:37:57,922
I haven't seen you around here.

608
00:37:58,006 --> 00:37:59,838
You just haven't been looking.

609
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,755
Would you like to see my apartment?

610
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,254
I'm not supposed to.

611
00:38:06,756 --> 00:38:08,296
Do you want to come
to my apartment or not?

612
00:38:10,006 --> 00:38:11,838
I'm not supposed to,

613
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:14,713
but I can make an exception.

614
00:38:16,923 --> 00:38:19,296
Would you take a credit card?

615
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,797
I'm joking.

616
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,922
Come on, get in.

617
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:36,338
I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde,

618
00:38:36,422 --> 00:38:38,922
who does couples. Couples.

619
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:43,421
And I really can't stress
"blonde" enough. Blonde.

620
00:38:46,589 --> 00:38:49,922
I'm Paul. My name's Paul Allen.

621
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:51,838
You got that?

622
00:38:51,923 --> 00:38:55,922
You're Christie.
You're to respond only to Christie.

623
00:38:56,005 --> 00:38:57,421
Is that clear?

624
00:39:07,506 --> 00:39:09,463
That's a very fine chardonnay
you're drinking.

625
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:12,296
I want you to clean your vagina.

626
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,463
No. From behind. Get on your knees.

627
00:39:24,547 --> 00:39:27,379
You have a very nice body.

628
00:39:39,922 --> 00:39:42,087
Thank you. Send her up.

629
00:39:45,255 --> 00:39:48,171
Christie, get out and dry off,

630
00:39:48,255 --> 00:39:49,838
choose a robe,

631
00:39:49,922 --> 00:39:51,379
not the Bijan,

632
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,921
and come and meet me and our guest

633
00:39:53,963 --> 00:39:56,338
in the living room for drinks.

634
00:40:02,756 --> 00:40:04,755
You've arrived! How lovely.

635
00:40:04,798 --> 00:40:06,755
Let me take your coat.

636
00:40:06,798 --> 00:40:09,671
I'm Paul. How good of you to come.

637
00:40:14,422 --> 00:40:16,546
Not quite blonde, are you?

638
00:40:16,589 --> 00:40:18,421
More dirty blonde.

639
00:40:18,506 --> 00:40:21,588
I'm gonna call you Sabrina.

640
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:24,046
I'm Paul Allen.

641
00:40:41,963 --> 00:40:43,588
So,

642
00:40:44,464 --> 00:40:46,463
don't you want to know what I do?

643
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:51,463
No.

644
00:40:51,547 --> 00:40:53,463
No, not really.

645
00:40:54,672 --> 00:40:58,797
Well, I work on Wall Street

646
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,546
at Pierce & Pierce.

647
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:02,588
Have you heard of it?

648
00:41:11,672 --> 00:41:14,588
You have a really nice place here, Paul.

649
00:41:15,464 --> 00:41:16,713
How much did you pay for it?

650
00:41:17,422 --> 00:41:18,588
Well, actually,

651
00:41:18,672 --> 00:41:21,755
that's none of your business, Christie.

652
00:41:21,798 --> 00:41:25,463
But I can assure you,
it certainlywasn't cheap. No.

653
00:41:25,547 --> 00:41:27,588
No smoking. Not in here.

654
00:41:30,297 --> 00:41:31,671
Varda truffle?

655
00:41:34,422 --> 00:41:36,962
I don'twantyou to get drunk, but

656
00:41:37,047 --> 00:41:40,671
that's a very fine chardonnay
you're not drinking.

657
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,588
Do you like Phil Collins?

658
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:52,921
I've been a big Genesis fan

659
00:41:52,963 --> 00:41:57,046
ever since the release
of their 1980 album, Duke.

660
00:41:57,088 --> 00:41:58,505
Before that,

661
00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:02,087
I really didn't understand any oftheirwork.

662
00:42:02,172 --> 00:42:04,921
Itwas too artsy. Too intellectual.

663
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:07,879
Itwas on Dukewhere

664
00:42:07,922 --> 00:42:10,837
Phil Collins' presence
became more apparent.

665
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,630
I think Invisible Touch

666
00:42:15,714 --> 00:42:18,630
is the group's undisputed masterpiece.

667
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,671
It's an epic meditation on intangibility.

668
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:30,463
At the same time, it deepens and enriches

669
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:34,087
the meaning of the preceding three albums.

670
00:42:34,172 --> 00:42:37,087
Christie, take off the robe.

671
00:42:38,755 --> 00:42:40,921
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing

672
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:43,837
of Banks, Collins, and Rutherford.

673
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,713
You can practically hear every nuance
of every instrument.

674
00:42:48,755 --> 00:42:51,546
Sabrina, remove your dress.

675
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:55,713
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship
and sheer songwriting,

676
00:42:55,755 --> 00:42:58,588
this album hits a new peak
of professionalism.

677
00:42:58,672 --> 00:43:01,087
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?

678
00:43:02,464 --> 00:43:05,171
Take the lyrics to "Land of Confusion."

679
00:43:05,255 --> 00:43:08,254
In this song, Phil Collins
addresses the problems

680
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:10,754
of abusive political authority.

681
00:43:12,963 --> 00:43:17,588
In Too Deep is the most moving
pop song of the 1980s,

682
00:43:17,672 --> 00:43:20,588
about monogamy and commitment.

683
00:43:21,547 --> 00:43:23,588
The song is extremely uplifting.

684
00:43:23,672 --> 00:43:26,463
Their lyrics are as positive

685
00:43:26,547 --> 00:43:27,921
and affirmative

686
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:31,754
as anything I've heard in rock.

687
00:43:35,047 --> 00:43:37,463
Christie, get down on your knees

688
00:43:37,547 --> 00:43:40,630
so Sabrina can see your asshole.

689
00:43:40,713 --> 00:43:43,171
Phil Collins' solo career

690
00:43:43,255 --> 00:43:45,505
seems to be more commercial,

691
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:49,463
and therefore more satisfying
in a narrowerway.

692
00:43:49,547 --> 00:43:51,754
Especially songs like In The Air Tonight

693
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:54,296
and Against All Odds.

694
00:43:56,005 --> 00:43:58,004
Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it.

695
00:44:00,172 --> 00:44:02,796
But I also think Phil Collins works best

696
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,921
within the confines of the group
than as a solo artist.

697
00:44:06,963 --> 00:44:10,171
And I stress the word "artist."

698
00:44:14,422 --> 00:44:18,338
This is Sussudio. A great, great song.

699
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,505
A personal favorite.

700
00:44:30,922 --> 00:44:32,712
Look at the camera.

701
00:45:10,713 --> 00:45:13,046
Christie, look at the camera.

702
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:31,338
Don't touch the watch.

703
00:45:53,422 --> 00:45:55,129
Can we go now?

704
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:57,213
We're not through yet.

705
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:18,587
If they have a good personality and they're
not great-looking, then who fucking cares?

706
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:22,921
Just say, hypothetically, okay,
what ifthey have a good personality?

707
00:46:24,713 --> 00:46:26,087
I know, I know.

708
00:46:26,172 --> 00:46:28,879
There are no girls with good personalities.

709
00:46:28,922 --> 00:46:30,504
A good personality consists of a chick

710
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:33,545
with a little hard body
who'll satisfy all sexual demands

711
00:46:33,588 --> 00:46:35,463
without being too slutty about things

712
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:37,796
and who will essentially keep
her dumb fucking mouth shut.

713
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,379
The only girls with good personalities
who are smart,

714
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,879
or maybe funny or halfway intelligent
ortalented,

715
00:46:42,922 --> 00:46:46,046
though God knows what the fuck
that means, are ugly chicks.

716
00:46:46,088 --> 00:46:47,213
Absolutely.

717
00:46:47,255 --> 00:46:50,254
And this is because they have to make up
for how fucking unattractive they are.

718
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:52,213
You know what Ed Gein said
aboutwomen?

719
00:46:52,255 --> 00:46:53,587
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?

720
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,421
No. Serial killer. Wisconsin, in the '50s.

721
00:46:56,464 --> 00:46:57,587
What did Ed say?

722
00:46:57,671 --> 00:46:59,213
"When I see a pretty girl
walking down the street,

723
00:46:59,255 --> 00:47:03,670
"I think two things. One part of me wants
to take her out and talk to her,

724
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:05,796
"be real nice and sweet and treat her right."

725
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,338
And what did the other part of him think?

726
00:47:07,422 --> 00:47:11,254
What her head would look like on a stick.

727
00:47:15,922 --> 00:47:19,379
Hi, guys.
I want to get your opinion on something.

728
00:47:20,214 --> 00:47:22,754
It's my business card.

729
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:24,962
I decided to get a new one, too.

730
00:47:28,047 --> 00:47:29,754
Oh, that's...

731
00:47:29,797 --> 00:47:31,754
Very nice, Luis.

732
00:47:33,755 --> 00:47:35,087
Thank you.

733
00:47:49,214 --> 00:47:51,129
Listen, what about dinner?

734
00:47:51,214 --> 00:47:54,004
Is that all you ever have to contribute?
"What about fucking dinner?"

735
00:47:54,088 --> 00:47:56,921
Cheer up there, Bateman. What's the matter,
no shiatsu this morning?

736
00:47:57,005 --> 00:47:59,129
Keep touching me like that,
and you'll draw back a stump.

737
00:47:59,214 --> 00:48:01,587
- Hold on there, little buddy.
- Excuse me.

738
00:48:38,671 --> 00:48:42,796
God. Patrick. Why here?

739
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,670
I've seen you looking at me.

740
00:48:45,755 --> 00:48:47,296
I've noticed

741
00:48:47,379 --> 00:48:50,004
your hot body.

742
00:48:51,546 --> 00:48:53,420
Don't be shy.

743
00:48:53,505 --> 00:48:55,754
You can't imagine
how long I've wanted this,

744
00:48:55,797 --> 00:48:58,378
ever since that Christmas party
atArizona 206.

745
00:48:58,421 --> 00:49:01,921
You were wearing
that red-striped paisley Armani tie.

746
00:49:05,421 --> 00:49:07,296
I want you.

747
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:09,670
I want you, too.

748
00:49:10,088 --> 00:49:11,338
- Patrick.
- What is it?

749
00:49:12,713 --> 00:49:14,504
Where are you going?

750
00:49:15,421 --> 00:49:18,046
I've gotta return some videotapes.

751
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:53,254
Okay, Monday? The 20th.

752
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:54,921
Monday? That's...

753
00:49:55,005 --> 00:49:57,712
- Any Paul Allen?
- Reservation, no. No reservation, but...

754
00:49:57,755 --> 00:49:59,754
Kimball. I've been wanting to talk with you.

755
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:02,962
Come into my office.
Jean, greatjacket. Matsuda?

756
00:50:03,047 --> 00:50:06,879
Do you rememberwhere you were
the night of Paul's disappearance,

757
00:50:06,922 --> 00:50:09,004
which was on the 20th of December?

758
00:50:09,797 --> 00:50:11,046
God.

759
00:50:11,088 --> 00:50:14,087
I guess I was probably
returning videotapes.

760
00:50:17,588 --> 00:50:19,670
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.

761
00:50:19,755 --> 00:50:22,171
- That's notwhat I've got.
- What?

762
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:24,670
That's not the information I've received.

763
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:28,171
Well, wait.
What information have you received?

764
00:50:28,713 --> 00:50:31,046
Let me see.

765
00:50:33,379 --> 00:50:35,004
- You were with...
- Well, I could be wrong.

766
00:50:36,379 --> 00:50:38,378
When was the last time
you were with Paul Allen?

767
00:50:38,755 --> 00:50:42,754
We'd gone to a new musical called...

768
00:50:42,797 --> 00:50:44,545
O Africa, Brave Africa.

769
00:50:44,588 --> 00:50:47,670
Itwas a laugh riot. Thatwas about it.

770
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:49,796
I think we had dinner at Orso's.

771
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,253
No, Petal... No, Orso's.

772
00:50:51,338 --> 00:50:54,587
I hope I've been informative.
Long day. Bit scattered.

773
00:50:54,671 --> 00:50:56,796
I'm a little spent now, too.

774
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,962
But how about lunch in a week or so,

775
00:51:00,047 --> 00:51:02,171
when I've sorted out all this information?

776
00:51:02,254 --> 00:51:03,879
Great. Yes, I'd like that.

777
00:51:03,922 --> 00:51:07,420
And if you could try and pin down
where you were

778
00:51:07,505 --> 00:51:09,295
the night of Paul Allen's disappearance,

779
00:51:09,379 --> 00:51:11,087
itwould make my job a lot easier.

780
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:13,504
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.

781
00:51:17,254 --> 00:51:19,087
Huey Lewis and the News.

782
00:51:21,713 --> 00:51:25,046
Great stuff. I just bought it on myway here.
You heard it?

783
00:51:26,172 --> 00:51:27,962
Never.

784
00:51:28,047 --> 00:51:30,087
I mean, I don't really like singers.

785
00:51:30,172 --> 00:51:33,629
- Not a big music fan, huh?
- No, I like music.

786
00:51:34,005 --> 00:51:38,420
Just they're...
Huey's too black-sounding for me.

787
00:51:39,088 --> 00:51:40,545
To each his own.

788
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,796
So, lunch nextweek?

789
00:51:45,379 --> 00:51:47,378
I'll be there.

790
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:24,629
Will you call me before Easter?

791
00:52:24,713 --> 00:52:26,087
Maybe.

792
00:52:30,713 --> 00:52:32,129
What are you doing tonight?

793
00:52:32,213 --> 00:52:36,170
Dinner at River Café.
Au Bar afterwards, maybe.

794
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:37,962
That's nice.

795
00:52:39,588 --> 00:52:41,587
I never knew you smoked.

796
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,629
You never noticed.

797
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:50,212
Listen, Patrick,

798
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:53,170
can we talk?

799
00:52:58,047 --> 00:52:59,796
You look

800
00:53:00,254 --> 00:53:01,253
marvelous.

801
00:53:02,421 --> 00:53:06,253
There's nothing to say.
You're gonna marry Luis.

802
00:53:06,338 --> 00:53:08,253
Isn't that special?

803
00:53:10,296 --> 00:53:11,295
Patrick?

804
00:53:16,338 --> 00:53:18,087
Yes, Courtney?

805
00:53:20,588 --> 00:53:23,253
If I don't see you before Easter,

806
00:53:23,338 --> 00:53:25,504
have a nice one, okay?

807
00:53:30,546 --> 00:53:32,545
You, too.

808
00:53:39,213 --> 00:53:40,212
Patrick?

809
00:53:40,922 --> 00:53:42,587
Yeah?

810
00:53:44,005 --> 00:53:45,420
Nothing.

811
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:18,587
There's this theory now that
if you can catch the AIDS virus

812
00:54:18,671 --> 00:54:22,170
through having sexwith someone,
then you can catch anything.

813
00:54:22,254 --> 00:54:26,212
Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy,
hemophilia, leukemia,

814
00:54:26,254 --> 00:54:28,295
diabetes, dyslexia.

815
00:54:28,379 --> 00:54:31,045
I'm not sure,
but I don't think dyslexia's a virus.

816
00:54:31,087 --> 00:54:33,462
Who knows? They don't know that.

817
00:54:33,546 --> 00:54:35,545
Prove it.

818
00:54:47,005 --> 00:54:48,462
- Oh, God!
- What?

819
00:54:48,546 --> 00:54:50,378
It's a fucking milligram of sweetener.

820
00:54:50,421 --> 00:54:52,629
I wanna get high off this,

821
00:54:52,713 --> 00:54:54,462
not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal.

822
00:54:54,546 --> 00:54:57,253
It's definitelyweak, but I have a feeling
if we do enough of it, we'll be okay.

823
00:54:57,296 --> 00:55:00,712
Can you keep it down?
I'm trying to do drugs!

824
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:04,170
- Fuck you!
- Calm down. Do it anyway.

825
00:55:04,254 --> 00:55:07,754
That's right. That is, if the faggot
in the next stall thinks it's okay!

826
00:55:07,797 --> 00:55:09,337
- Fuck you!
- Hey, fuck you!

827
00:55:11,588 --> 00:55:13,921
Sorry, dude. The steroids.

828
00:55:13,963 --> 00:55:16,545
Okay, let's do it.

829
00:55:37,755 --> 00:55:39,253
Where did Craig go?

830
00:55:39,338 --> 00:55:41,253
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs.

831
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:44,045
McDermottwent to sign a peace treaty
between the United States and Russia.

832
00:55:44,087 --> 00:55:46,253
He's the one behind Glasnost.

833
00:55:46,296 --> 00:55:49,295
He said he was in mergers
and acquisitions.

834
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,128
You're not confused, are you?

835
00:55:51,213 --> 00:55:53,253
No, not really.

836
00:55:53,338 --> 00:55:55,086
Gorbachev is not downstairs.

837
00:55:55,129 --> 00:55:58,921
Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs.
He's at Tunnel.

838
00:55:59,004 --> 00:56:01,003
Ask me a question.

839
00:56:02,213 --> 00:56:04,170
So, what do you do?

840
00:56:04,254 --> 00:56:05,545
I'm into

841
00:56:05,588 --> 00:56:07,754
murders and executions, mostly.

842
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:11,670
- Do you like it?
- Well, it depends. Why?

843
00:56:11,755 --> 00:56:13,337
Well, most guys I know

844
00:56:13,421 --> 00:56:17,045
who work in mergers and acquisitions
really don't like it.

845
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:23,003
So, where do you work out?

846
00:56:25,713 --> 00:56:28,504
- You think I'm dumb, don't you?
- What?

847
00:56:28,588 --> 00:56:31,420
You think I'm dumb.
You think all models are dumb.

848
00:56:31,505 --> 00:56:34,337
No. I really don't.

849
00:56:34,421 --> 00:56:37,212
That's okay. I don't mind.

850
00:56:37,254 --> 00:56:39,212
There's something sweet about you.

851
00:57:06,755 --> 00:57:08,086
Doing the crossword?

852
00:57:12,463 --> 00:57:14,504
You need any help?

853
00:57:25,254 --> 00:57:26,253
Jean?

854
00:57:27,087 --> 00:57:28,378
Yes, Patrick?

855
00:57:28,421 --> 00:57:30,920
Would you like to
accompany me to dinner?

856
00:57:31,004 --> 00:57:33,920
That is, ifyou're not doing anything.

857
00:57:34,588 --> 00:57:37,378
No. No, I don't have any plans.

858
00:57:39,087 --> 00:57:40,961
Well.

859
00:57:43,254 --> 00:57:45,086
Isn't this a coincidence?

860
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:47,629
- Listen, where should we go?
- Anywhere you want.

861
00:57:47,713 --> 00:57:50,712
Let's not think aboutwhat I want.
How about anywhere you want?

862
00:57:53,129 --> 00:57:55,253
I don't know, Patrick.
I can't make this decision.

863
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:57,253
Come on.

864
00:57:57,338 --> 00:58:00,170
Where do you want to go?
Anywhere you want.

865
00:58:00,254 --> 00:58:03,253
Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.

866
00:58:04,379 --> 00:58:06,003
What about

867
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:16,128
Dorsia?

868
00:58:22,463 --> 00:58:23,795
So,

869
00:58:25,046 --> 00:58:27,462
Dorsia is where Jean wants to go.

870
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:31,212
I don't know.
No, we'll go whereveryou want to go.

871
00:58:31,254 --> 00:58:33,128
Dorsia is fine.

872
00:58:39,921 --> 00:58:41,587
Dorsia. Yes?

873
00:58:41,671 --> 00:58:44,545
Yeah, can you take two tonight
at, well, let's say 9:00?

874
00:58:44,588 --> 00:58:47,420
- We're totally booked.
- Really? That's great.

875
00:58:47,463 --> 00:58:51,253
- No, I said we are totally booked.
- Two at 9:00? Perfect.

876
00:58:51,296 --> 00:58:53,003
See you then.

877
00:58:56,046 --> 00:58:58,253
Yeah.

878
00:58:58,296 --> 00:58:59,462
You're

879
00:59:01,087 --> 00:59:02,086
dressed okay.

880
00:59:03,421 --> 00:59:05,086
You didn't give a name.

881
00:59:05,129 --> 00:59:06,670
They know me.

882
00:59:07,379 --> 00:59:10,378
Why don't you meet me at my place at 7:00,

883
00:59:11,296 --> 00:59:12,587
for drinks.

884
00:59:13,796 --> 00:59:15,420
And, Jean?

885
00:59:15,754 --> 00:59:17,795
You'll want to change before we go out.

886
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:27,961
Patrick, it's so elegant.

887
00:59:28,879 --> 00:59:30,420
What a wonderful view.

888
00:59:30,754 --> 00:59:31,753
Jean?

889
00:59:32,671 --> 00:59:34,170
Sorbet?

890
00:59:36,254 --> 00:59:38,587
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.

891
00:59:44,421 --> 00:59:46,253
Do you want a bite?

892
00:59:46,296 --> 00:59:48,337
I'm on a diet. But thank you.

893
00:59:48,421 --> 00:59:51,920
You don't need to lose anyweight.
You're kidding, right?

894
00:59:52,004 --> 00:59:53,961
You look great. Very fit.

895
00:59:55,421 --> 00:59:58,420
You can always be thinner, look better.

896
00:59:58,463 --> 01:00:00,629
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner.

897
01:00:00,712 --> 01:00:02,920
I don'twant to ruin yourwillpower.

898
01:00:03,004 --> 01:00:05,795
No, it's all right.

899
01:00:05,879 --> 01:00:08,920
I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.

900
01:00:12,087 --> 01:00:13,836
So, listen,

901
01:00:13,921 --> 01:00:17,170
what do you reallywant
to do with your life?

902
01:00:17,254 --> 01:00:19,295
Just briefly. Summarize.

903
01:00:19,379 --> 01:00:22,253
And don't tell me you enjoy
working with children, okay?

904
01:00:22,296 --> 01:00:25,295
Well, I'd like to travel

905
01:00:25,379 --> 01:00:29,753
and maybe go back to school,
but I don't really know.

906
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:34,128
I'm at a point in my life where there
seems to be so many possibilities.

907
01:00:35,296 --> 01:00:37,629
But I don't know. I'm just so unsure.

908
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:43,587
Do you have a boyfriend?

909
01:00:44,171 --> 01:00:46,253
No, not really.

910
01:00:46,296 --> 01:00:47,753
Interesting.

911
01:00:47,837 --> 01:00:51,504
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?

912
01:00:52,338 --> 01:00:53,920
Maybe.

913
01:00:53,962 --> 01:00:55,669
I don't know.

914
01:00:56,254 --> 01:00:57,669
Not really.

915
01:01:00,546 --> 01:01:01,587
Jean,

916
01:01:02,254 --> 01:01:04,836
do you feel fulfilled?

917
01:01:04,921 --> 01:01:07,711
I mean, in your life?

918
01:01:07,754 --> 01:01:11,462
I guess I do. For a long time,
I was too focused on mywork.

919
01:01:11,546 --> 01:01:14,920
But now I've really begun to think
about changing myself.

920
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:18,462
You know, developing and growing.

921
01:01:18,546 --> 01:01:20,128
Growing.

922
01:01:20,213 --> 01:01:22,212
I'm glad you said that.

923
01:01:25,796 --> 01:01:29,086
Did you know that Ted Bundy's
first dog, a collie,

924
01:01:29,129 --> 01:01:31,587
was named Lassie?

925
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:35,170
- Had you heard this?
- Who's Ted Bundy?

926
01:01:37,046 --> 01:01:39,462
Forget it.

927
01:01:41,421 --> 01:01:42,420
What's that?

928
01:01:42,505 --> 01:01:45,669
Duct tape. I need it for

929
01:01:46,587 --> 01:01:48,003
taping something.

930
01:01:52,463 --> 01:01:53,504
Patrick?

931
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:58,586
Have you everwanted to
make someone happy?

932
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:01,253
What? No! Put it in the carton!

933
01:02:02,712 --> 01:02:03,920
Sorry.

934
01:02:06,254 --> 01:02:07,253
Jean?

935
01:02:08,754 --> 01:02:10,253
What?

936
01:02:12,087 --> 01:02:14,628
Make someone happy.

937
01:02:14,712 --> 01:02:16,711
Have you everwanted to?

938
01:02:19,379 --> 01:02:21,545
I'm looking for...

939
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:28,920
I guess you could say I just want
to have a meaningful relationship

940
01:02:28,962 --> 01:02:31,337
with someone special.

941
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:43,920
Patrick. Patrick. I know you're there.

942
01:02:43,962 --> 01:02:46,170
Pick up the phone, you bad boy.

943
01:02:46,254 --> 01:02:50,337
What are you up to tonight?
It's me. Don't try to hide.

944
01:02:50,421 --> 01:02:52,586
I hope you're not out
with some little numberyou picked up,

945
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:54,586
because you're mine, Mr. Bateman.

946
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:57,378
My boy next door.

947
01:02:57,421 --> 01:02:59,878
Anyway, you never called me,
and you said you would.

948
01:02:59,921 --> 01:03:02,669
And I'll leave a message
for Jean about this, too, to remind you,

949
01:03:02,754 --> 01:03:04,961
but we're having dinner
with Melania and Taylor.

950
01:03:05,046 --> 01:03:07,045
You know Melania.
She went to Sweet Briar.

951
01:03:07,087 --> 01:03:09,420
And we're meeting at the Cornell Club,

952
01:03:09,504 --> 01:03:11,586
so I'll call you tomorrow morning, honey.

953
01:03:11,629 --> 01:03:14,045
Oh. Sorry. I know you hate that.

954
01:03:14,087 --> 01:03:17,337
Bye, Patrick. Bye, Mr. Big-time CEO.

955
01:03:17,421 --> 01:03:19,503
Bye-bye.

956
01:03:22,921 --> 01:03:24,878
Was that Evelyn?

957
01:03:28,712 --> 01:03:31,045
Are you still seeing her?

958
01:03:35,254 --> 01:03:38,544
I'm sorry. I have no right to ask that.

959
01:03:42,754 --> 01:03:44,669
Do you want me to go?

960
01:03:45,921 --> 01:03:47,544
Yeah.

961
01:03:49,921 --> 01:03:52,628
I don't think I can control myself.

962
01:03:54,962 --> 01:03:56,337
I know. I should go.

963
01:03:56,421 --> 01:04:00,045
I know I have a tendency to
get involved with unavailable men.

964
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,003
I mean,

965
01:04:05,379 --> 01:04:07,378
do you want me to go?

966
01:04:08,837 --> 01:04:11,128
I think if you stay,

967
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:13,378
something bad will happen.

968
01:04:15,421 --> 01:04:17,086
I think I might hurt you.

969
01:04:18,587 --> 01:04:20,920
You don'twant to get hurt, do you?

970
01:04:21,004 --> 01:04:23,170
No. No, I guess not.

971
01:04:24,712 --> 01:04:27,045
I don'twant to get bruised.

972
01:04:29,421 --> 01:04:32,212
You're right. I should go.

973
01:04:37,837 --> 01:04:40,337
Oh. Don't forgetyou have
a lunch date tomorrow

974
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:42,795
with Donald Kimball
at Smith and Wollensky.

975
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,419
Thanks.

976
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:48,544
It slipped my mind completely.

977
01:05:07,587 --> 01:05:09,003
So,

978
01:05:10,087 --> 01:05:11,628
the night he disappeared,

979
01:05:11,712 --> 01:05:14,419
any new thoughts aboutwhatyou did?

980
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:19,337
Not sure. I had a shower

981
01:05:20,754 --> 01:05:22,045
and some sorbet.

982
01:05:22,087 --> 01:05:23,961
I think you're getting your dates mixed up.

983
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:29,086
Well, where do you place Paul that night?

984
01:05:29,171 --> 01:05:32,711
According to his date book,
and this was verified by his secretary,

985
01:05:32,754 --> 01:05:35,669
he had dinnerwith Marcus Halberstram.

986
01:05:35,754 --> 01:05:37,920
- And?
- I questioned him.

987
01:05:38,087 --> 01:05:39,086
Marcus.

988
01:05:39,171 --> 01:05:42,253
Yes, and he denies it.
Though, at first, he couldn't be sure.

989
01:05:43,087 --> 01:05:45,586
- But he denied it?
- Yes.

990
01:05:46,629 --> 01:05:48,586
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?

991
01:05:48,629 --> 01:05:50,753
Yes.

992
01:05:50,796 --> 01:05:54,170
- He does? You're sure?
- I've checked it out. It's clean.

993
01:05:58,254 --> 01:06:01,669
Now, where were you?

994
01:06:01,754 --> 01:06:03,878
Where was Marcus?

995
01:06:04,587 --> 01:06:06,086
He wasn'twith Paul Allen.

996
01:06:06,378 --> 01:06:08,336
Who was he with?

997
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:10,878
He was atAtlantis

998
01:06:10,921 --> 01:06:13,253
with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble,

999
01:06:13,296 --> 01:06:15,003
Harry Newman, George Butner,

1000
01:06:15,087 --> 01:06:17,669
and you.

1001
01:06:21,921 --> 01:06:23,753
Oh, right, yeah. Of course.

1002
01:06:26,171 --> 01:06:28,086
He had wanted Paul Allen to come,

1003
01:06:28,171 --> 01:06:30,253
but he had made plans,

1004
01:06:30,296 --> 01:06:34,253
and I guess I had dinner
with Victoria the following night.

1005
01:06:34,337 --> 01:06:36,753
Personally, I think the guy
went a little nutso,

1006
01:06:36,837 --> 01:06:38,419
split town for a while.

1007
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:41,711
Maybe he did go to London,
sightseeing, drinking, whatever.

1008
01:06:41,754 --> 01:06:44,586
Anyway, I'm pretty sure
he'll turn up sooner or later.

1009
01:06:44,629 --> 01:06:47,503
I mean, to think that one
of his friends killed him

1010
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:51,419
for no reason whatsoever
would be too ridiculous.

1011
01:06:51,462 --> 01:06:53,711
Isn't that right, Patrick?

1012
01:07:14,921 --> 01:07:16,711
Christie. Christie!

1013
01:07:17,004 --> 01:07:20,753
I'm not so sure about this.
I had to go to Emergency after last time.

1014
01:07:20,837 --> 01:07:23,586
This won't be anything like last time.
I promise.

1015
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:26,461
I don't think so.

1016
01:07:26,545 --> 01:07:29,753
Just come in the limo
and talk to me for a minute.

1017
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:31,836
The driver's here. You're safe.

1018
01:07:50,587 --> 01:07:53,045
Nothing like last time. I promise.

1019
01:07:53,087 --> 01:07:55,045
All right.

1020
01:07:55,087 --> 01:07:58,419
So, you're looking great. How've you been?

1021
01:07:58,462 --> 01:08:01,628
Well, I actually might need
a little surgery after last time.

1022
01:08:01,712 --> 01:08:05,461
- Really?
- My friend told me I should get a lawyer.

1023
01:08:06,629 --> 01:08:09,377
Lawyers are so complicated.

1024
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:10,961
Don't do that.

1025
01:08:12,087 --> 01:08:13,753
Here's a check.

1026
01:09:01,587 --> 01:09:03,086
Uh-uh.

1027
01:09:03,129 --> 01:09:05,628
Half now, half later.

1028
01:09:10,629 --> 01:09:14,252
Okay. Your name's Christie.

1029
01:09:14,295 --> 01:09:17,045
We're meeting a friend of mine, Elizabeth.

1030
01:09:17,087 --> 01:09:21,628
She'll bejoining us
in my new apartment shortly.

1031
01:09:21,712 --> 01:09:24,961
You'll like her. She's a very nice girl.

1032
01:09:32,046 --> 01:09:34,628
You look really familiar.
Did you go to Dalton?

1033
01:09:37,004 --> 01:09:39,753
I think I metyou at the Surf Bar, didn't I?
With Spicey?

1034
01:09:39,796 --> 01:09:43,003
Maybe notwith Spicey, but definitely
at Surf Bar. You know, Surf Bar?

1035
01:09:43,087 --> 01:09:45,252
Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now. It's terrible.

1036
01:09:45,337 --> 01:09:49,419
Went to a birthday party there
for Malcolm Forbes. Oh, my God, please.

1037
01:09:50,462 --> 01:09:53,127
This is nicerthan your other apartment.

1038
01:09:55,378 --> 01:09:57,461
Well, it's not that nice.

1039
01:10:02,087 --> 01:10:03,753
Where did you two meet?

1040
01:10:03,837 --> 01:10:05,753
Oh, God. We met at...

1041
01:10:05,837 --> 01:10:10,085
Oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby
in '85 or '86.

1042
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:12,419
You were hanging out
with that bimbo Allison Poole.

1043
01:10:12,504 --> 01:10:13,836
Hot number.

1044
01:10:13,921 --> 01:10:15,920
What do you mean? She was a hot number.

1045
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:17,878
If you had a platinum card,
she'd give you a blow job.

1046
01:10:17,921 --> 01:10:20,586
This girl worked at a tanning salon.
Need I say more?

1047
01:10:21,295 --> 01:10:23,252
What do you do?

1048
01:10:23,337 --> 01:10:25,795
She's my

1049
01:10:25,879 --> 01:10:27,544
cousin.

1050
01:10:28,921 --> 01:10:29,920
She's from

1051
01:10:30,796 --> 01:10:31,795
France.

1052
01:10:32,086 --> 01:10:34,711
Where's your phone? I've gotta call Harley.

1053
01:10:39,921 --> 01:10:41,878
Where do you summer? Southampton?

1054
01:10:43,086 --> 01:10:44,085
No.

1055
01:10:44,504 --> 01:10:47,544
- Oh, God. It's his machine.
- Elizabeth, it's 3.00 in the morning.

1056
01:10:47,921 --> 01:10:50,252
He's a goddamn drug dealer.
These are his peak hours.

1057
01:10:50,295 --> 01:10:52,419
- Don't tell him you're here.
- Whywould I?

1058
01:10:53,128 --> 01:10:54,503
This tastes weird.

1059
01:10:54,587 --> 01:10:56,586
Harley, it's me. I need your services.

1060
01:10:56,629 --> 01:10:58,920
Translate that howeveryou want.

1061
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:00,836
I'm at...

1062
01:11:02,086 --> 01:11:04,044
- You're at Paul Allen's.
- Who?

1063
01:11:04,086 --> 01:11:06,669
- Paul Allen.
- I want the number, idiot.

1064
01:11:06,754 --> 01:11:09,252
Anyway, I'm at Paul Normand's,
and I'll try you again later.

1065
01:11:09,295 --> 01:11:13,044
If I don't see you at Canal Bartomorrow
night, I'm gonna sic my hairdresser on you.

1066
01:11:13,086 --> 01:11:16,628
Did you know that guywho disappeared?
Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce?

1067
01:11:16,712 --> 01:11:19,711
- Was he a friend ofyours?
- No.

1068
01:11:19,754 --> 01:11:22,669
Do you have any coke? Or Halcion?

1069
01:11:22,754 --> 01:11:24,419
Oh, I would take a Halcion.

1070
01:11:24,462 --> 01:11:26,127
Listen.

1071
01:11:27,504 --> 01:11:29,586
I would just like to see

1072
01:11:29,629 --> 01:11:32,211
the two of you get it on.

1073
01:11:34,587 --> 01:11:35,669
What's wrong with that?

1074
01:11:35,754 --> 01:11:37,044
It's totally disease-free.

1075
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:42,795
- Patrick, you're a lunatic.
- Come on.

1076
01:11:42,879 --> 01:11:45,044
Don't you find Christie attractive?

1077
01:11:45,086 --> 01:11:48,878
Let's not get lewd.
I'm in no mood for a lewd conversation.

1078
01:11:48,921 --> 01:11:51,419
Come on.

1079
01:11:51,462 --> 01:11:53,544
I think it'd be a turn-on.

1080
01:11:53,587 --> 01:11:55,211
Does he do this all the time?

1081
01:11:57,545 --> 01:12:00,294
Christie, you're not drinking yourwine.

1082
01:12:01,754 --> 01:12:04,169
You're telling me
you've never gotten it on with a girl?

1083
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:07,419
No. I'm not a lesbian.

1084
01:12:07,504 --> 01:12:10,419
Whywould you think I would be into that?

1085
01:12:10,462 --> 01:12:12,377
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence,
for one thing.

1086
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:15,336
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick.

1087
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:17,711
You're making me feel weird.

1088
01:12:22,128 --> 01:12:23,753
Did you know

1089
01:12:23,796 --> 01:12:27,377
that Whitney Houston's debut LP,

1090
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:30,336
called simply Whitney Houston,

1091
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:33,294
had four number-one singles on it?

1092
01:12:34,921 --> 01:12:36,836
Did you know that, Christie?

1093
01:12:36,921 --> 01:12:40,252
You actually listen to Whitney Houston?

1094
01:12:40,337 --> 01:12:43,294
You own a Whitney Houston CD?

1095
01:12:44,629 --> 01:12:46,252
More than one?

1096
01:12:47,837 --> 01:12:50,711
It's hard to choose a favorite
among so many great tracks,

1097
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:55,795
butThe Greatest Love of All

1098
01:12:55,879 --> 01:13:00,544
is one of the best,
most powerful songs everwritten

1099
01:13:00,587 --> 01:13:04,669
about self-preservation, dignity.

1100
01:13:04,754 --> 01:13:08,377
Its universal message
crosses all boundaries

1101
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:12,252
and instills one with the hope

1102
01:13:12,337 --> 01:13:15,836
that it's not too late to better ourselves.

1103
01:13:16,837 --> 01:13:20,211
Since, Elizabeth,

1104
01:13:20,253 --> 01:13:23,503
it's impossible in this world we live in

1105
01:13:23,587 --> 01:13:25,169
to empathize with others,

1106
01:13:25,253 --> 01:13:27,960
we can always empathize with ourselves.

1107
01:13:29,045 --> 01:13:31,669
It's an important message.

1108
01:13:31,754 --> 01:13:33,211
Crucial, really.

1109
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,753
And it's beautifully stated on the album.

1110
01:14:50,378 --> 01:14:52,002
Not the face, you bitch!

1111
01:14:52,086 --> 01:14:55,586
Not the fucking face,
you piece of bitch trash!

1112
01:16:23,961 --> 01:16:26,752
I want a firm commitment.

1113
01:16:26,836 --> 01:16:28,586
I think, Evelyn,

1114
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:30,586
thatwe've lost touch.

1115
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:32,336
Why? What's wrong?

1116
01:16:35,795 --> 01:16:37,877
My need to engage in homicidal behavior

1117
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,710
on a massive scale cannot be corrected,

1118
01:16:40,753 --> 01:16:43,710
but I have no otherway to fulfill my needs.

1119
01:16:45,337 --> 01:16:48,169
- We need to talk.
- Talk aboutwhat, Patrick?

1120
01:16:48,253 --> 01:16:50,294
It's over, Evelyn.

1121
01:16:50,378 --> 01:16:52,877
It's all over.

1122
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:56,085
Touchy, touchy.
I'm sorry I brought up the wedding.

1123
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:59,794
Let's just avoid the issue, all right?
Now, are we having coffee?

1124
01:16:59,878 --> 01:17:02,960
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us.

1125
01:17:03,045 --> 01:17:06,085
This is nojoke.

1126
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:08,503
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

1127
01:17:08,587 --> 01:17:12,919
Butyourfriends are my friends,
and my friends are yourfriends.

1128
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:16,336
I really don't think itwould work.
You have a little something...

1129
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:19,169
I know thatyourfriends are my friends,

1130
01:17:19,253 --> 01:17:21,544
and I've thought about that.

1131
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:23,752
You can have them.

1132
01:17:25,212 --> 01:17:28,127
- You're really serious, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

1133
01:17:31,587 --> 01:17:34,294
What about the past? Our past?

1134
01:17:34,378 --> 01:17:35,752
We never really shared one.

1135
01:17:35,836 --> 01:17:37,919
- You're inhuman.
- No.

1136
01:17:37,961 --> 01:17:39,835
I'm in touch with humanity.

1137
01:17:41,253 --> 01:17:43,044
Evelyn, I'm sorry.

1138
01:17:43,086 --> 01:17:44,461
I just...

1139
01:17:45,628 --> 01:17:47,752
You're not terribly important to me.

1140
01:17:48,587 --> 01:17:50,252
Oh, no!

1141
01:17:50,753 --> 01:17:52,835
No! No!

1142
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:57,503
I know my behavior
can be erratic sometimes.

1143
01:17:58,753 --> 01:18:01,919
What do you want me to do?
What is it thatyou want?

1144
01:18:02,003 --> 01:18:05,461
If you reallywant to do something for me,
then stop making this scene right now.

1145
01:18:05,545 --> 01:18:08,960
- Oh, God, I can't believe this.
- I'm leaving.

1146
01:18:09,045 --> 01:18:11,919
I've assessed the situation, and I'm going.

1147
01:18:11,961 --> 01:18:14,252
- Where are you going?
- Just leaving.

1148
01:18:14,337 --> 01:18:15,503
Butwhere?

1149
01:18:17,462 --> 01:18:19,919
I have to return some videotapes.

1150
01:18:50,586 --> 01:18:52,585
Here, kitty, kitty.

1151
01:19:08,711 --> 01:19:10,835
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

1152
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,960
Stop that.

1153
01:19:54,753 --> 01:19:57,002
Drop the weapon! Drop it now!

1154
01:19:57,086 --> 01:19:59,169
Get on the ground! Put...

1155
01:20:42,128 --> 01:20:44,543
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith?

1156
01:20:44,586 --> 01:20:47,294
Hey, now don't forget to sign in.

1157
01:21:26,669 --> 01:21:28,211
Hi.

1158
01:22:16,086 --> 01:22:19,919
Harold, it's Bateman. Patrick Bateman.

1159
01:22:20,003 --> 01:22:22,336
You're my lawyer, so I think
you should know, I've killed a lot of people.

1160
01:22:22,419 --> 01:22:25,252
Some escort girls in an apartment uptown,

1161
01:22:27,086 --> 01:22:29,044
some homeless people, maybe five orten,

1162
01:22:29,086 --> 01:22:31,085
an NYU girl I met in Central Park,

1163
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:33,418
I left her in a parking lot
behind some doughnut shop.

1164
01:22:33,503 --> 01:22:36,127
I killed Bethany,
my old girlfriend, with a nail gun,

1165
01:22:36,212 --> 01:22:40,919
and some man...
Some old faggotwith a dog.

1166
01:22:41,003 --> 01:22:45,085
Lastweek, I... I killed another girl

1167
01:22:45,128 --> 01:22:47,085
with a chain saw.

1168
01:22:49,795 --> 01:22:52,960
I had to. She almost got away.

1169
01:22:55,045 --> 01:22:56,960
Someone else there. I can't remember.

1170
01:22:57,045 --> 01:23:00,127
Maybe a model. But she's dead, too.

1171
01:23:00,212 --> 01:23:02,752
And Paul Allen.

1172
01:23:02,836 --> 01:23:06,710
I killed Paul Allen with an ax in the face.

1173
01:23:06,753 --> 01:23:11,044
His body is dissolving
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen.

1174
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:13,044
I don'twant to leave anything out here.

1175
01:23:13,086 --> 01:23:15,919
I guess I've killed maybe 20 people,

1176
01:23:15,961 --> 01:23:17,960
maybe 40.

1177
01:23:19,377 --> 01:23:22,627
I have tapes of a lot of it.

1178
01:23:22,711 --> 01:23:25,085
Some of the girls have seen the tapes.

1179
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:27,085
I even...

1180
01:23:34,961 --> 01:23:37,169
I ate some of their brains.

1181
01:23:38,503 --> 01:23:40,794
And I tried to cook a little.

1182
01:23:43,753 --> 01:23:45,335
Tonight, I...

1183
01:23:46,961 --> 01:23:50,919
I just had to kill a lot of people,

1184
01:23:51,003 --> 01:23:52,877
and

1185
01:23:56,170 --> 01:24:01,169
I'm not sure
I'm gonna get awaywith it this time.

1186
01:24:04,252 --> 01:24:07,085
So I mean...

1187
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,919
I guess

1188
01:24:10,961 --> 01:24:12,752
I'm a pretty...

1189
01:24:14,461 --> 01:24:17,044
I mean, I guess I'm a pretty sick guy.

1190
01:24:19,086 --> 01:24:21,710
So,

1191
01:24:21,753 --> 01:24:23,919
if you get back tomorrow,

1192
01:24:24,961 --> 01:24:27,085
I may show up at Harry's Bar.

1193
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:28,877
So, you know.

1194
01:24:30,294 --> 01:24:32,585
Keep your eyes open.

1195
01:26:51,753 --> 01:26:54,126
Are you my 2:00?

1196
01:26:54,211 --> 01:26:55,210
No.

1197
01:26:57,127 --> 01:26:59,210
Can I help you?

1198
01:26:59,252 --> 01:27:03,376
I'm looking for Paul Allen's place.

1199
01:27:04,377 --> 01:27:06,418
Doesn't he live here?

1200
01:27:06,503 --> 01:27:08,293
No, he doesn't.

1201
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:11,460
You sure?

1202
01:27:11,544 --> 01:27:13,710
You saw the ad in the Times?

1203
01:27:13,753 --> 01:27:16,752
No. Yeah. I mean, yeah.

1204
01:27:16,795 --> 01:27:20,293
- In the Times.
- There was no ad in the Times.

1205
01:27:21,753 --> 01:27:23,960
I think you should go now.

1206
01:27:24,045 --> 01:27:25,752
But I think...

1207
01:27:28,294 --> 01:27:29,752
I want to know what happened here.

1208
01:27:29,836 --> 01:27:32,919
Don't make any trouble, please.

1209
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:35,002
I suggestyou go.

1210
01:27:47,419 --> 01:27:49,084
Don't come back.

1211
01:27:49,169 --> 01:27:51,585
I won't.

1212
01:27:51,628 --> 01:27:53,293
Don'tworry.

1213
01:28:23,419 --> 01:28:25,001
Patrick Bateman's office.

1214
01:28:25,085 --> 01:28:28,460
- Jean? I need help.
- Patrick, is thatyou?

1215
01:28:29,628 --> 01:28:31,210
Jean, I'm not...

1216
01:28:32,211 --> 01:28:34,210
Craig McDermott called.
He wants to meetyou,

1217
01:28:34,252 --> 01:28:36,668
David Van Patten, and Tim Bryce
at Harry's for drinks.

1218
01:28:36,753 --> 01:28:38,376
Oh, God.

1219
01:28:38,419 --> 01:28:40,627
What did you say, you dumb bitch?

1220
01:28:40,711 --> 01:28:44,585
- Patrick, I can't hear you.
- What am I doing?

1221
01:28:44,669 --> 01:28:46,668
Where are you, Patrick? What's wrong?

1222
01:28:48,753 --> 01:28:52,668
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean,

1223
01:28:52,753 --> 01:28:55,251
to the office this afternoon.

1224
01:28:55,294 --> 01:28:57,418
Why?

1225
01:28:57,503 --> 01:28:59,835
Just say no!

1226
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:02,251
What is it, Patrick? Are you all right?

1227
01:29:03,127 --> 01:29:06,543
Stop sounding so fucking sad!

1228
01:29:07,169 --> 01:29:08,959
Jesus!

1229
01:30:25,461 --> 01:30:26,794
Table forthree.

1230
01:30:26,877 --> 01:30:30,210
Bateman, you look a little wild-eyed.
Rough day at the office?

1231
01:30:30,252 --> 01:30:32,918
Look, Bryce is back,
and he's drinking mineral water.

1232
01:30:33,002 --> 01:30:36,251
He's a changed man, except he still
can't get a reservation to save his life.

1233
01:30:36,336 --> 01:30:38,502
Why don't you just try 150 Wooster?

1234
01:30:38,586 --> 01:30:42,126
I'm not going anywhere
unless we have a reservation.

1235
01:30:42,211 --> 01:30:44,959
Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar.

1236
01:30:45,044 --> 01:30:47,001
Come on, faggots, let's get a res.

1237
01:30:47,085 --> 01:30:49,835
Keep your shirt on.
Maybe lose the suspenders.

1238
01:30:49,919 --> 01:30:51,959
Need a reservation for 8:30.

1239
01:30:52,044 --> 01:30:54,543
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back.

1240
01:30:54,586 --> 01:30:57,126
10:00 would not be any good, no.

1241
01:30:57,211 --> 01:30:58,710
Just fucking call them.

1242
01:30:58,753 --> 01:31:00,710
- Give me the phone. I'll do it.
- I'll call you back.

1243
01:31:00,753 --> 01:31:04,168
Face it. The Japanese will own most
of this country by the end of the '90s.

1244
01:31:04,252 --> 01:31:06,918
Shut up, Carnes. Theywill not.

1245
01:31:08,336 --> 01:31:12,084
So, Harold, did you get my message?

1246
01:31:13,211 --> 01:31:15,084
Jesus, yes! Thatwas hilarious.

1247
01:31:15,127 --> 01:31:17,794
- Thatwas you, wasn't it?
- Yeah, naturally.

1248
01:31:17,877 --> 01:31:20,210
Bateman killing Allen and the escort girls.
That's fabulous.

1249
01:31:20,252 --> 01:31:22,210
- That's rich.
- What exactly do you mean?

1250
01:31:22,252 --> 01:31:25,335
The message you left.
By the way, Davis, how's Cynthia?

1251
01:31:25,419 --> 01:31:28,834
- You're still seeing her, right?
- Wait, Harold. What do you mean?

1252
01:31:28,919 --> 01:31:32,168
Excuse me. Nothing. It's good to see you.

1253
01:31:32,252 --> 01:31:33,959
Is that Edward Towers?

1254
01:31:35,753 --> 01:31:37,251
Wait.

1255
01:31:37,419 --> 01:31:38,418
Davis.

1256
01:31:39,711 --> 01:31:41,752
I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone.

1257
01:31:41,835 --> 01:31:44,418
Yourjoke was amusing, but come on, man.

1258
01:31:44,461 --> 01:31:47,084
You had one fatal flaw.

1259
01:31:47,169 --> 01:31:49,126
Bateman is such a dork.

1260
01:31:49,211 --> 01:31:52,834
Such a boring, spineless lightweight.

1261
01:31:52,919 --> 01:31:56,752
Now if you said Bryce or McDermott...
Otherwise, itwas amusing.

1262
01:31:56,835 --> 01:31:59,460
Now ifyou'll excuse me,
I really must be going.

1263
01:31:59,544 --> 01:32:00,876
Wait.

1264
01:32:02,252 --> 01:32:04,418
Stop.

1265
01:32:04,461 --> 01:32:06,418
I did it, Carnes.

1266
01:32:07,586 --> 01:32:08,918
I killed him.

1267
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,710
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1268
01:32:14,753 --> 01:32:17,084
I chopped Allen's fucking head off.

1269
01:32:18,336 --> 01:32:23,502
The whole message
I left on your machine was true.

1270
01:32:23,586 --> 01:32:26,251
Excuse me. I really must be going now.

1271
01:32:27,169 --> 01:32:29,418
No, listen.

1272
01:32:29,503 --> 01:32:32,043
Don't you knowwho I am?

1273
01:32:32,085 --> 01:32:34,918
I'm not Davis. I'm Patrick Bateman.

1274
01:32:37,752 --> 01:32:40,876
We talk on the phone all the time.

1275
01:32:41,294 --> 01:32:42,959
Don't you recognize me?

1276
01:32:45,002 --> 01:32:46,751
You're my lawyer.

1277
01:32:48,377 --> 01:32:50,751
Now, Carnes,

1278
01:32:50,835 --> 01:32:52,376
listen.

1279
01:32:52,419 --> 01:32:54,627
Listen very, very carefully.

1280
01:32:58,586 --> 01:33:00,460
I killed Paul Allen,

1281
01:33:02,419 --> 01:33:03,918
and I liked it.

1282
01:33:04,919 --> 01:33:07,751
I can't make myself any clearer.

1283
01:33:07,835 --> 01:33:09,793
But that's simply not possible.

1284
01:33:09,877 --> 01:33:11,918
And I don't find this funny anymore.

1285
01:33:12,002 --> 01:33:14,251
It neverwas supposed to be.

1286
01:33:14,294 --> 01:33:16,335
- Why isn't it possible?
- It's just not.

1287
01:33:16,419 --> 01:33:19,834
Why not, you stupid bastard?

1288
01:33:20,419 --> 01:33:25,210
Because I had dinnerwith Paul Allen
twice in London, just 10 days ago.

1289
01:33:25,252 --> 01:33:27,293
No, you

1290
01:33:29,752 --> 01:33:31,168
didn't.

1291
01:33:31,252 --> 01:33:33,251
Now, ifyou'll excuse me.

1292
01:34:13,710 --> 01:34:15,959
We've seen the results of that mistrust

1293
01:34:16,044 --> 01:34:19,709
in the form of lies, divisions, and mistakes.

1294
01:34:19,752 --> 01:34:21,959
We need to find a way to cooperate

1295
01:34:22,044 --> 01:34:24,126
while realizing foreign policy

1296
01:34:24,211 --> 01:34:26,667
can't be run by committee.

1297
01:34:26,752 --> 01:34:29,418
And I believe there's now
the growing sense

1298
01:34:29,503 --> 01:34:33,293
that we can accomplish more
by cooperating.

1299
01:34:33,377 --> 01:34:37,251
And, in the end, this may be
the eventual blessing in disguise

1300
01:34:37,336 --> 01:34:39,293
to come out of the Iran-Contra mess.

1301
01:34:39,586 --> 01:34:41,751
How can he lie like that?

1302
01:34:43,085 --> 01:34:45,043
- How can he pull that shit?
- What shit?

1303
01:34:45,085 --> 01:34:47,543
Nowwhere do we have reservations at?

1304
01:34:47,586 --> 01:34:50,251
I'm not really hungry, but I'd like
to have reservations someplace.

1305
01:34:50,336 --> 01:34:53,084
How can you be so fucking...

1306
01:34:53,169 --> 01:34:55,793
I don't know... Cool about it?

1307
01:34:55,877 --> 01:34:58,418
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.

1308
01:35:04,169 --> 01:35:05,168
Bateman?

1309
01:35:06,336 --> 01:35:08,084
What are you so fucking zany about?

1310
01:35:08,127 --> 01:35:11,584
I'm just a happy camper.

1311
01:35:11,627 --> 01:35:12,834
Rockin' and a-rollin'!

1312
01:35:14,627 --> 01:35:16,251
Oh, brother! Look.

1313
01:35:16,336 --> 01:35:19,251
He presents himself
as this harmless old codger,

1314
01:35:19,294 --> 01:35:21,335
but inside...

1315
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:23,751
But inside...

1316
01:35:24,169 --> 01:35:26,335
But inside doesn't matter.

1317
01:35:27,336 --> 01:35:31,418
Inside? Yes? Inside? Believe it or not,
Bryce, we're actually listening to you.

1318
01:35:31,461 --> 01:35:34,084
Come on, Bateman, what do you think?

1319
01:35:36,919 --> 01:35:39,084
Whatever.

1320
01:35:39,169 --> 01:35:41,626
Whose moronic idea was it
to order dry beers?

1321
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:43,376
I need a scotch.

1322
01:35:45,294 --> 01:35:47,793
When I named him to
the U.S. Court of Appeals,

1323
01:35:47,877 --> 01:35:50,293
the American Bar Association...

1324
01:35:59,585 --> 01:36:02,584
There are no more barriers to cross.

1325
01:36:02,627 --> 01:36:05,168
All I have in common
with the uncontrollable

1326
01:36:05,252 --> 01:36:08,251
and the insane, the vicious and the evil,

1327
01:36:08,294 --> 01:36:12,084
all the mayhem I have caused
and my utter indifference toward it,

1328
01:36:12,169 --> 01:36:14,542
I have now surpassed.

1329
01:36:17,377 --> 01:36:20,251
My pain is constant and sharp,

1330
01:36:20,336 --> 01:36:24,043
and I do not hope
for a betterworld for anyone.

1331
01:36:24,085 --> 01:36:28,626
In fact, I want my pain
to be inflicted on others.

1332
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:30,918
I want no one to escape.

1333
01:36:33,085 --> 01:36:35,210
But even after admitting this,

1334
01:36:35,252 --> 01:36:37,460
there is no catharsis.

1335
01:36:37,543 --> 01:36:40,293
My punishment continues to elude me,

1336
01:36:40,377 --> 01:36:43,667
and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself.

1337
01:36:43,752 --> 01:36:47,584
No new knowledge can be
extracted from my telling.

1338
01:36:47,668 --> 01:36:51,751
This confession has meant nothing.
