OVER BLACK:
The sound of HELICOPTER ROTORS slicing through the air.

          Jesus, God. . .
 ON:
An ARMY HELICOPTER as it soars over the thick LOUISIANA BAYOU.
Lush and green only a day ago, the foliage below has been
ripped to shreds. The kind of damage that can only be done
by nature.
SUPERIMPOSE:, FEBRUARY 2 - 0630 HOURS - 32 KILOMETERS NORTH
OF FORT MCKINLEY, LOUISIANA

I'm just doing a favor for Colonel Styles because he wants to know if anyone else who's still out there is in need of assistance. To be honest with you, though, I don't care about that either. Dunbar looks up at this, surprised.</dialogue>
      <dialogue id="s14d8" name="HARDY">I don't know those guys, you do. They die, to me, it's like seeing a couple people died in a fire on the news - tragic, but it doesn't affect me.
